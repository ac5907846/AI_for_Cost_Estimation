Estimator,Current Accuracy Limitations and Need for Oversight,"It's not to the level yet that it's saying what it is. So I mean it can pick out a toilet or something that's assembled, but it can't drill in yet to the level that I know they're heading towards in the future."
A,Manual Review Still Required,But the result is is that you still have to go in and know what it is. It's not. It's not to the level yet that it's saying what it is.
A,Fear of Errors Without Human Oversight,"The part that I was nervous about AI is if it. Makes a mistake and you didn't catch the mistake. You know, so I liked the fact that all it was automating was the points that you had to select on the edge of the room rather than."
A,Concern About AI Making Quantity Decisions,"I was my biggest fear of AI is that I mean the quantities aren't the the thought process of estimating it's you know, how are you gonna get it done? So I was very nervous. People were just gonna start taking quantities, plugging them into a spreadsheet and saying that's what it costs and they weren't gonna drill into the, OK?"
A,Need for Direct Data Transfer to Estimating Software,So that's how we came to get togal the the one thing that I want to happen next is for it to be able to dump the information right into the estimate.
A,Current Download Process as Interim Solution,"Which it did. You know it. You'd have to still. Now you have to download it. To excel and then now there's benefits to it, at least if you do that, you're in that to bring the numbers in, you should be looking at them more than."
A,Custom Integration Development,"We can, if we once we lock into the software that we're gonna use, we will be able to design something internally that I'm being told. Told that will take that data and then put it in the estimate."
A,Time-Saving Search Capabilities,"The other thing that's great about the AI type. Benefits of it are. When you're trying to find a a note, it's a lot. You can find it a lot quicker just by asking you know. The. AI portion, you know, what's the building code rather than flipping through 50 sheets of paper trying to find that note, it can find it instantly and lead you to it."
A,Automated Information Retrieval,"Other benefits that I see, and it is, you know, by pulling out the spec and finding out what some of the material is, AI can lead you to their, you know, it used to take a long time to, you know, you grab the suites manual and you be. Flipping through to find the manufacturer looking for detail. Now with AI you tell it this is the model number. It'll it'll find it on the Internet and pop it up for you so you can look at it right away."
A,Focus on Automation,"It's it's the searching. And it's the things that take you time to do that are not that are more automated like I mean that's what it's all about, that the automatic things are move faster."
A,Current Effectiveness with 2D Elements,Right now the the technology that we're seeing like in Togal is does very good in two dimension things that you need 2 dimensions for.
A,Limitations with Complex 3D Systems,"Say a pipe is going under the slab and then it pops up in a wall and goes over. I mean, it's hard for AI to to get the full. You know, on an automated basis and see it can't take. It's not like it's looking at a section, it's it's reading a section, so it's not putting the, you know now as as I mean the big issue is is that."
A,Wall Type Recognition Limitations,"You really, I mean you end up. It's not like AI goes in and says, all right, this is a two way wall. This is a 3 way wall. This is a four way wall and the height is this much other than over here. That wall cuts down because of the slab the 2nd floor."
A,BIM Model Quality Issues,"So the result is is that until and a lot of that is, is that you know over the I mean. Design fees are always clients are always pushing down on the design fees. You know. Their design used to be. I mean, the average design was 10%. You know, not counting ca, it was 10% design."
A,Training and Development Concerns,"The biggest risk that I see on it is I keep wondering where we're gonna get. How we're gonna develop? The new people in the industry as AI cause a like I said, AI takes all the automation away or takes all the automatic duties that you do."
A,Entry-Level Impact,"So and all the activities that it's gonna take away are the things that you start your productive doing early in your career. It's a, you know, one of those necessary things. Doing carpet takeoffs is necessary. But if AI can do it, what duties are you gonna give the the entry people to cut their teeth on as? They're learning."
A,Historical Training Methods Under Threat,"You know, when I started out, there was a lot of things that AI can you know? I I he could have probably taken. 80% of my work day away with AI. So how are we gonna fill in that 80%? With productive work that's gonna give the training to the person to be able to develop. So that 10 years down the road there is seasoned estimator."
A,Industry Adoption Readiness,"I don't think the the industry isn't opposed to it. Especially with the fact that it's harder to get labor. So anything you can do to automate, it's gonna be. You know, fully embraced."
A,Historical Pricing Data Integration,"I'd love a software that, and I've seen and some of them have it, where it pulls up the last 20 jobs you estimated and does like a scatter chart of where the unit prices were so they could start seeing that the prices are different depending on the scen."
A,Need for Price Analysis Tools,At least they're plugging in a number that's in the range. And then we can talk and make the estimate review more useful by having discussions on why is this higher than this and actually go through it.
A,Software Integration Challenges,The trouble with estimating software is every one of them does something good. It's just every one of them doesn't do the same things good. So it's like if I if I could take the 50 top estimating softwares and pull the features I like from everyone.
A,Future of AI Standardization,I think AI is gonna be used by everyone and it's gonna be it's gonna be implemented. I don't think there'll be one company that'll. Be the the end. So I just think that. Every estimating software is eventually gonna have their own version of toggle.
A,Continued Development Expected,"I mean, AI is definitely gonna make it make what we can do better. It's just a matter of time and how people implement it."
A,Pricing Assistance Limitations,"So that's I don't see as much assistance on the pricing. In store bought as I see the the like I said, the only thing I've ever really seen and a lot of them do it is tie it to a subscription to Rs means."
A,Real-Time Model Updates Challenge,"It still comes down to once the person gonna type it in. You know, and it still comes down to when an RFI gets responded to from an architect. It's not like they're responding to it in the drawings, they're responding to it on a form that says this is my question."
A,Manual Process Dependencies,"It's gonna take a lot of. It's gonna take some time, and it's gonna have to take where AI itself can make these changes, because people are never gonna go in and actually do it."
B,Cross-checking and verification capabilities,So I think that that definitely assist you gives you a form of checks and balance where you don't have to necessarily do it twice or you know you have to go back and repeat the work or anything like that. I think is very helpful in that aspect.
B,Comparing AI results with manual work,"They have a square footage. Or they say they have a linear footage of 100 linear feet and you apply that to a 10 foot wall. But you know you have 1000 square feet versus, oh, you did your takeoff manually and you only came up with 980. So now you know, OK. There's a difference here, and maybe you're able to find that difference and close that gap."
B,AI assists with base calculations,"It really assists with. The my base numbers. It's when I start doing just a a gross square footage or a footprint square footage, it can help pick up that type of information."
B,Current architectural limitations,"Oh, it has more features, lending to architectural quantity, takeoff. So we can see your plan in it and say OK, this is one room, it'll select that square footage."
B,Need for broader discipline coverage,You want to get more into MEP or civil? It doesn't really recognize that right now to my knowledge.
B,Limitations in structural and MEP work,"Yes, right now, like I said, you can't use it really with concrete structural metals. MEP NE is not, you know, doing duct count or converting it to pounds. It's not picking up like. Any silver work or anything like that, but within architectural it's a very great tool."
B,Future expansion expectations,"And I think that they're going more into the building systems where they're trying to do it more 3D. Where you can see you know your wall, ceiling floors flushed out more and make sure you have complete building systems with that. And I I only think that the MEP will come after that."
B,Collaborative workflow features,"I definitely think it has improved the collaboration when working on larger projects, we're able to work on the same project at the same time and have our isolated work views or 'cause. You can put it in two different modes like this is my view versus this is sh."
B,Automated drawing organization,"When you first start in your uploading your drawing into Toko and it loads the the package it. Auto name all of the pages for you. You don't have to go through and name like. A-100, a 101, it'll. Read the drawing and it'll say OK. This is the drawing number. This is the drawing title and apply it to the whole package."
B,Document search integration,"I use that a lot and also within Toko they have a a feature where it searches through the documents in the specs book. So if you have a question about a particular rebar or detail, it can search within that information to help you. And that's utilizing AI in that format to assist you."
B,Pattern recognition features,They also are rolling out the pattern search. Which is similar to the image search where you know you could take a window selection of the pattern and it'll look for it. If you have maybe like a brick layout or maybe a flooring pattern.
B,Image search functionality,"But you could search for an image. So if you're doing a quantity takeoff and you see a symbol for an emergency light in your place, and normally you would go in and say, OK, I see one."
B,Automated scale detection,"Oh yeah, this is also part of the AI feature that they have. They automatically pull the scale for you and you're able to modify it if required."
B,Manual oversight still required,"But you still have to go in and say, OK, yes, yes, yes, 'cause it may pick up just a circle. So it's it's in the beginning phases, but it does help a lot and it tends to be pretty accurate when the symbol is very clear."
B,Adaptable takeoff methods,"And and do manual take off utilizing the tools in different ways versus the architectural. It's more. Is more intuitive to use within the architectural quantity takeoffs we have. Wall ceilings, floors, doors, windows."
B,Learning curve considerations,"I think I have an unfair advantage on that one. I was able to pick it up within a couple of days, but I I learned software really quickly. 'cause I have a background in 3D technical design."
B,Data dependency limitations,I guess AI in general you kinda have a a shorthand based on the data that the the AI is able to provide information from. Because if it doesn't have that information to you know process and send back out then you don't have a source. You have to kind of go back to the old school method to do to do research.
B,Industry adoption challenges,"I think that it will become standard eventually, but it will take a a long time for people to adopt those principles. Within AI, people within construction industry tend to be. Opposed to new technology in the way that is developing and growing."
C,Scaling Accuracy Issues,"I'm noticing that for AI it it can implement so many different things like it gives you the auto scaling. Already, but sometimes AI isn't accurate. Like it gives you a different scale than what the drawings show. So you always have. It's not like a guarantee like you have to make sure the scaling is correct."
C,Need for Quality Control,"However, I think that since it's technology and. Still improving, but like I think it still needs to be checked like. Like scaling, scaling is a huge one when you're if the scale is wrong, the whole quantity's wrong. So I I I think like it's better to have like a backup to determine the quantities but I I think I think it could like impact."
C,Auto-naming Interface Improvements,Some of like the when you're doing auto naming and all that. So you have to like get the whole full bar of it like if some there's like so many words in the text you have to if like make it larger instead compared to like 1 words.
C,Time-Saving Workflow Benefits,Auto naming tool so like you get like a A+ sign that you like. Hover over like the document drawings and it it would auto name the the drawings for you and you can see in the top left hand corner of the screen that. Summarizes what the the plan is called so you don't have to manually do it like on implants with you have to manually type in the name of the drawing which I it took me like 30 minutes to do that for my capstone project and it just.
C,Workflow Efficiency,It's so much time consuming and totally AI brings it down to like a few few minutes.
C,Collaboration Features,Like depending on the size of the project we we would break each division down by person like me and another coworker are working on it. We can see actually see who's doing what. And we can see everyone's view on on total like their their from.
C,Integration with Existing Tools,I'd probably say probably 24 hours like a week like I I used to go AI and then I'd switch over to excel and jot down the line items for each division and then go go through Rs means and put down the pricing for each line item.
C,Limited Integration Capabilities,"I prefer togal markup and toggle so much better, but when you're like you can't really put pictures into toggle. So I like to use bluebeam and say like. Pricing of Grout is actually this. They have the pricing of grout for this and compare the costs and add diagonal lines to it. In total, you can't really do that."
C,Learning Curve and Training,"So like I had to learn it by myself and it took me about about 5 days 5 working days to to learn it, yeah."
C,Cost-Benefit Analysis,I think I'd purchase Togo AI like if I was working for a different general contractor because it's there's so much valuable information to it. And it gets things done a lot quicker and I feel like the I'm way more accurate using that tool.
C,Future Industry Impact,"I strongly believe that AI is gonna. I would say it's gonna take over the construction industry, but I wouldn't say that it's gonna remove us from like remove the majority of estimators from being able to have like a job because of how quick AI can get things done."
C,Project Type Effectiveness,"I would say like for the larger projects like aviation, I would say it's more helpful because there's like a lot of sheets to go through. And more details that are essential for for the project and like for warehouse building."
D,Accuracy Improvements and Manual Oversight Needs,Like when you do a search when we do a search image like it's analyzing the pattern pattern of it so it can accurately give us like. I cannot tell you like 100% it gives right. But we also need to manually check it. So it gives like 98% accuracy I can tell.
D,Pattern Recognition Superiority,"In image search I would opt togal is. 75% better than bluebeam. Because like in Bluebeam, it's not doing as accurate as togal is doing it. 'Cause bluebeam is not analyzing the pattern of the design which we are selecting it."
D,AI Learning vs Traditional Methods,"In Togal, when you in for example, I can tell you clearly if in bluebeam they are like data outlets. There are too many data outlets. I told you like differentiates of data outlets. If I select the data outlet of one data outlet in search image in BLUEBEAM for example, it's only considering the outer triangle. Yeah, but in in total AI, the difference is when we select the same image, it's also considering the internal pattern of the image what we selected."
D,Limitations in MEP Systems,"So far, can the AI help you? Anything with something like MEP or maybe not not a lot. No, not a lot. Not a lot. It has M."
D,Need for Broader Coverage,"It has improved anything in this one. I can send you this one if you if you share me your e-mail or I already have your e-mail like we have discussed in Outlook, right?"
D,Current Integration Workflow,And we take the quantities out of togal AI. And we export it to the Excel according to the divisions.
D,Vision for Increased Automation,"I mean like 80% AI can handle it like where it makes us to concentrate more where it allows me to concentrate more on the prizes and stuff instead of doing. More 70%, which can be done for that. Where it can be completely automatic, like AI ones. Not completely automatic."
D,Desire for Seamless Integration,So we can include the price database to it. So when we give the type and. Age of the door so it automatically pops up the price beside it.
D,3D Visualization Needs,"So I feel like a 3D visualization have to be developed from 2D drawings. And I'm not asking. I'm not saying like do a BIM, a 3D model and do it, because that's an additional cost. Nobody does it."
D,Current 3D Limitations,"The total shows an isometric view like two walls, but the total doesn't show the doors. So we we are. It would be more good for a user. If it shows like a 3D visualization from the 2D picture, did you get it like 3D visualization from the 2D picture?"
D,Enhanced Visual Representation,"Instead of looking like a blue, some blue or purple color or something like that, it shouldn't look like that. If I say it's a wall, it should look like a wall. Every person needs to visualize like how does it be from the 2D plans. So I feel like it should actually look like a wall."
D,User-Friendly Interface Vision,"So that's how I wanted feel like like AI is actually integrated into estimating. Order placing kiosk like when you click on a burger like they ask like chicken bur. Which one you want? Like chicken or something to add it. OK let me add chicken. OK. Do you want to add mayonnaise to it? Yeah, mayonnaise."
D,Customizable Workflow Options,"I should have option like walls click on it. My walls, plywood walls, pmu walls. What type of walls you want? I want drywall OK. Click on drywall. Then you need to get ten options like single sided drywall, double sided drywall fire, rated drywall."
D,Simplified User Interaction,It should ask US options rather than we always putting like line and putting each line item with the name 1 sided. Single sided rival partition 3 inch thickness that shouldn't be like that.
D,Tiered Pricing for Different Users,Any software which is regarding to AI estimating have to be in phase wise like like subscription like normal AI generated estimating software. Middle range of AI estimating software. Would go estimating software a integrated pro estimate because all the all types of the construction businesses doesn't want pro integrated AI.
D,Scalability for Different Company Sizes,"Because not everyone is willing to. Because, for example, I can tell you like there I I have a roof company. Or else I have a roof company only. So for me, I don't need so much of AI integrated to it because I just need to measure the whole area of this one, get the slopes, get the number of sheets."
D,Global Market Considerations,"Yeah, because not only like 1 country, right? Like, it's like concentrate on other countries too, which are not even like developed as us. The dollar price over here when we convert into our currencies more. It's $1.00 over here is the ₹80 in India."
D,Time Efficiency and Focus Shift,"So like so, we don't want to waste the time on counting the outlets and we want to concentrate on the more important things like reconciliation, value, engineering analysis, the way we can save the money was the actual cost of the curtain wall."
D,Industry Modernization,"So always like AI is fast and for me AI is fascinating in construction industry. I feel like the only industry which always follows the traditional method. Is construction, so I wanted to change that."
D,Economic Efficiency,"They don't want somebody to be paid like $40 or $50.00 an hour counting just that duplex out outlets all the 8 hours a day and wasting those time the company. No, company doesn't want it. Basically, company wants it to. Now the work to be quicker."
E,Current accuracy limitations and need for improvement,"Yeah, not too much to it, because sometimes it gets a little quirky... But yeah, if it's like simple things like, you know, doing a simple count, I I typically use that tool for the simple count."
E,Accuracy as primary concern for future development,"Oh, I don't think I have any concerns, just the accuracy of it all that will be my only concern. Just to make sure things are."
E,AI learning user behavior for personalization,"It would be nice if, like AI can learn the particular estimators. Like behavior when it comes to estimating like what are they like their whole set up?... Like, hey, what line items do you want to have? OK, what colors do you want to put to this light, Adam? What's the unit of measurement you want to do like it can kind of learn you to make it more, you know, more of a AI assistant type of thing."
E,Current workflow inefficiencies requiring multiple software,So we'll have to go open on one screen and bluebeam on the other screen just to kind of review the documents at the same time.
E,Need for more streamlined automation,"Sometimes to go back in and to just like move a line or something. Like that it kind of gets to a little too much time consuming. So like I said, I kind of wish it was like a more click and go type of situation."
E,Quality check and alert systems,"Before you move on to the next page to know like, hey, you didn't take off all the things you know... I feel like if AI could identify things we may have not had taken off on the page should be like, hey, you missed this part you. Make sure that you have everything."
E,Touch-based interaction for easier takeoffs,"I think it could be easier if it was like more like. A touch like you know you can move up to like if you have a room and there's like, a certain desk that you just wanna take off. Like you could just touch it and identify it and then you can attach it to whatever assigned quantity or product item."
E,Pattern recognition for similar elements,"I'm going to or maybe like it just for it to easily identify like if I'm taking off this particular feature, like if I'm taking off slab on deck, it can identify what other slab on deck is on the actual plans... Like it would just kind of pick up like, oh, they're taking off slab on deck. Oh, they're slab on deck over here."
E,Search functionality improvements,"I know I think they have it on a a Togo AI, but the whole the search option where you can maybe type in a question I think they have it but it doesn't pick up on certain things where you can type in the question and it'll quickly find. It on the drawings."
E,Email automation for construction professionals,"No, no they don't. I wish. I wish it was for emails, but no, our company hasn't got there yet with the AI e-mail... one of the person that I interview, he say he received so many e-mail a day, like 200 e-mail a day and he wish he had something automatically raining or even like answering some non important e-mail."
E,Project-specific effectiveness variations,"I think what aviation is a little easier because because of the plans, I guess with the electrical and if you need to do light counts and everything like that... I think hospitality, I think it, I find it a little more difficult to use the AI tool because of the sometimes you know they put a lot of lines and patterns and all that stuff."
E,Concern about over-dependence on AI,"I think with AI it's also gonna make people a little more lazy here... It's gonna be like if if people gonna want it to be a mind reader, but it's not a mind reader... I just think people, if they can work alongside with it, I think it would be a lot better. Versus just being 100% dependent on it."
F,Current Accuracy Limitations and Need for Manual Oversight,"As far as accuracy goes, I would say that there's still a lot of learning to do on like the application, so I do have to check everything to make sure that the accuracy is right 'cause sometimes it will miss like a rumor or something or a few access. So you do have to double check the work still, but I would say that there has been times where... I have like I haven't seen a certain material. And it it'll point it out for you, which is nice, but I would say the accuracy, it's not 100% there yet."
F,Accuracy Performance Assessment,"I would say I I check everything just to be sure, but I would say probably it's accurate... 70% of the time, yeah."
F,Need for Division-Based Organization,I think having it broken down by the divisions would be helpful.
F,Current Limitations to Floor Plans,"And then also it is only you can only use it for floor plans right now. So if you could plug in a model or like a 3D model, something like that. And it could do take off that way. That would be super helpful."
F,Renovation Work Challenges,"And normally when you do have a clubhouse renovation plan, if you plug it in to toggle. Or another software. It doesn't recognize the shaded portion. So you basically have to do still a manual take off if you are doing a renovation work, because it can't recognize this is the part that you're doing, and this is the part you're not."
F,Workflow Integration Challenges,"So I would say that's probably the most difficult part about the AI right now. Is that a lot of people are still skeptical of it, and a lot of people that have been in the industry longer that aren't used to it... Don't necessarily see it as a tool, so I do think that's probably the hardest part is getting people to use it and to switch from their current software is over."
F,Reporting and Documentation Integration,We can like screenshot them and get reports from the toggle AI for accounts and everything like that to report back to whether it be like subcontractors or owners. If we have to show how we did the quantities.
F,3D Model Integration Desire,"So if you could plug in a model or like a 3D model, something like that. And it could do take off that way. That would be super helpful."
F,Image Search Functionality,"I would say mainly for 'cause we use it for speeding up the process the the search tool, specifically the image search tool... It has an app like a app on there that you can basically almost like screenshot an image from actual plans and it'll tell you the quantity."
F,Selective Takeoff Control,"It would be really helpful. Basically with toggle. It allows you to click on and off for what takeoff you want to do. So if you want to just do specialties you can just do specialties or if you want to do like the center lines and stuff you can. Do that, but I think having it broken down by the divisions would be helpful."
F,Plan Quality Requirements,"So especially with toggle, while like you could put a plan in and the plans basically have to be close to complete, which for budgeting purposes or like schematic design, that's that's not gonna happen."
F,Training and Support Infrastructure,"The actual owners of toggle AI, they have training videos and then once a week they do kind of like watch and learn. So kind of videos and then live videos as well to teach you how to use any of their updated software."
F,Adoption Timeline Concerns,"I don't see it necessarily being a larger thing until probably 10-15 years from now... So I would say that that's probably something that within the next like 10 to 15 years is more people. We'll get into the workplace that have already started out, like in college and things using these softwares."
F,Productivity and Time Savings Motivation,"So we mainly work with clubhouses and multi family especially with multi family. When you're doing takeoff for four or five residential buildings at a time, it can take you almost up to like half a day to do a full takeoff... So really, for just productivity, we decided to try out toggle. Speed up the process at all."
F,Learning and Skill Development Concerns,"What I am a little more concerned about with is that the way I learned about the industry was really from my internship in doing the take offs and you really get to see. How a project is built in kind of that way and even the small little details, that's how you learn. And I do think that as people are introduced to take off software while they're still in college, and while they're still learning that they might overlook certain things in... Their career, which is what makes a good estimator, is that you don't overlook those things."
F,Consistency Challenges,"I think kind of just the consistency with everything... So I would say probably just the consistency of how accurate everything is, because you can't necessarily count on it all the time... You don't know if it's going to be like if it's going to work one day with one set of plans versus another."
G,Trust and Reliability Concerns,"So for takeoff, we don't at the moment. It's just at the moment we don't really trust it."
G,Accuracy Verification Needs,"However, how I like to use it 'cause it'll still not tell you the right thing."
G,AI Hallucination Issues,Yeah. Yeah. I just telling you something that's incorrect. So like hallucinating something or something like that. Or just completely missing something.
G,Current AI Understanding,"No, I think. I I think I understand it pretty well. I'm just skeptical of it because it kind of still makes stuff up sometimes. Like even our even our contract software still makes things up sometimes or doesn't understand properly. So you have to double check it."
G,Software Integration Challenges,I wish we could kind of do take off in Sage. Didn't have to transfer our data from plan Swift to Sage.
G,Document Processing Capabilities,"For contract, since they're usually signed on paper and then photocopied in, you can't use like bluebeam to search EM. But with document crunch it scans it and it kinda kinda since it's AI can find the words you're looking for."
G,AI for Keyword Search,So I use document. It crunched a lot to search for keywords.
G,Current Workflow Efficiency,An excel which is goes into an Excel sheet out of sage and then we copy that into our word proposals and we use word to create all of our proposals.
G,Learning Curve and Training Needs,"Not really. As long as the company wants to actually give training 'cause you know, some companies kinda just wanna sell you the software and then not talk to you."
G,Simple vs. Complex Software Preferences,"Lions was a little bit easier to use than bluebeam for takeoff. It's a little bit just more user friendly, but bluebeam's probably a little bit more powerful."
G,Training and Support Requirements,"But yeah, as long as the company actually wanted to do the training was there for questions. That's really what matters."
G,Time-Consuming Manual Processes,Take off is time consuming for sure. Particularly just when you don't have good drawings. It's really it's really hard. But the another thing that's probably really time consuming is just following up with subcontractors and trying to get them to make sure they give you the right information.
G,Drawing Quality and Coordination Issues,"Yeah, most mostly just there's just a lot of takeoff. And then if there, if the drawings aren't good and they don't tell you enough detail, it's hard to figure out."
G,Edge Case Handling Requirements,And then how it handles like edge cases where the drawings aren't good? So if it just how it handles edge cases and things like that.
G,Specific Technical Challenges,"I think the issue with it would be the fact that it can't take off specific like types of flooring or things like that. So when we do our takeoff, we title all of our takeoff or we're doing the tile and we're doing the carpet and we're doing the this. Or especially with the walls, because I saw it took off all the walls, but it didn't take em off based on wall types."
G,Cost and Value Considerations,"Yeah, I'm sure reliability would be one of the biggest ones and then follow closely would be cost."
G,Current Technology Adoption,"I think it would be something we will probably look at, but I just know mostly we just don't have the time to look at it right now."
G,Future Technology Trends,"I'm not too sure it will have to see how the AI stuff does, and if it gets better. But. I think the most important prior right now is like Sage."
H,Market Analysis Automation,"That's actually a place that I think AI can be very helpful. So just to point that out, because, like right now we're, we've actually invested in a program and we haven't. It's not other money yet, but. They basically part of this program. What it does for us is they will go get good results from the dot."
H,AI Database Integration,So what they're talking about is I guess you can have an AI agent that you could. Send into like your estimating database and have it pull certain threads of information together for you.
H,Streamlining Document Review,"Take an entire spec book and put it into ChatGPT and ask it to look for. Specific requirements that might make the job hard bid. So there are things that I think can make your job as an estimator easier. Rather than reading those 400 page stat book, if you can get a summary and then you know, know that the the problem is right now we chat GP2, you don't know how. In depth it's looking."
H,Schedule Integration Potential,"But that's also something that maybe AI could do would be, you know, like take your bid and build a lot based off your your bid."
H,Current AI Limitations,"I think it's very helpful. I think the problem with S and AI mean I think it would be very helpful if they gathering the data. The problem with estimating is the part the gambling part, because there are business decisions that you probably wouldn't want to pay. So I think there will always be a personal aspect to it, but I do think that there are many ways, like for example something that we just started doing recently is you can.
Take an entire spec book and put it into ChatGPT and ask it to look for. Specific requirements that might make the job hard bid. So there are things that I think can make your job as an estimator easier. Rather than reading those 400 page stat book, if you can get a summary and then you know, know that the the problem is right now we chat GP2, you don't know how. In depth it's looking. But it's definitely it definitely does pick up on. So we're testing it out."
H,Business Decision Boundaries,"The problem with estimating is the part the gambling part, because there are business decisions that you probably wouldn't want to pay. So I think there will always be a personal aspect to it, but I do think that there are many ways."
H,Current Manual Processes,"A lot of it is by fuel and just by paying attention to the market and then, you know, we keep some spreadsheets and things like that."
H,Workflow Automation for Reminders,"So that's kinda helpful. Umm and I think like it could be that same kind of thing for estimating, whereas we put together a schedule of all our bids. You know we review that on a daily basis and we have reminders like I think you know to a certain. Extent like AI could do those reminders for you."
H,Administrative Task Automation,"It's like we have some people using pro pilot and having it. Anticipate, you know, responses to emails or. You know, following up on deadlines and stuff like that."
H,Complex Traffic Management Challenges,"I would say because every job is different. You know, like there's different MOT requirements, I would say for for roadway construction, MLT plan and the requirements trying to figure out the things in and what work is going to be available on each phase is probably the most time consuming because once you understand that part of."
H,Specialty Work Coordination,"So for example. There was a specialty wall on the Daniel Parkway job that required soil anchors and you know, basically putting up temporary features to hold the soil back. While this wall was poured in place and it was complicated. And there's only like a couple different contractors that would do that. And sometimes if they're busy, it's hard to get prices."
H,Market Intelligence Needs,"Like would it be helpful to pull you know of all the jobs that we got and see what those trends are? Do, are we more successful getting jobs from you know? 1000 to 5000 times or 5000 to 25,000 times and so on and so forth."
H,Data Analysis for Competitive Intelligence,"And then I can kind of look at it and say, oh, well, they've got $100 million worth of dot work in this area. So they're probably not looking to pick up another giant job right now. So I mean it's like little things like that, you know, trying to judge. Where the market is like a little bit of a gambling, part of that to me."
H,Subcontractor Scope Completeness,"So a lot of times you don't know that until they send you the price and then you're at the last minute trying to figure out what we're missing and normally like, that's not a great place to be."
I,Drawing Quality Dependency,"The AI can only put out a product based on how good the drawings are. So if you get an architect that doesn't label things properly OK or... if the design team doesn't do their job. Right, the AI tool can can really mess you up so."
I,Human Oversight Necessity,"The human component still needed in the industry. You know, we still need someone to look at those things and make sure."
I,Verification Challenge,"And then at that point, you ask yourself if I still have to double check the AI take off, how can I? How? The only way I can do that is for me to do my own takeoff."
I,Proposal Analysis Integration,"I would love to see an AI tool that can read six or seven proposals for plumbing six or seven proposals for painting and tell me based on what they read, which one has my scope of work."
I,Specification Cross-Reference,One thing they would do is check the spec book. See everything that's on the spec book and tell me if the bids I received cover everything.
I,Time-Saving Automation,You know that would be an useful tool that I could use and I would appreciate it so much 'cause that will save me so much time.
I,Error Identification System,"The software should be able to cloud call out, corrected an area where it couldn't find what we're looking for. OK, should be able to tell me. Hey, I couldn't get data from this area. Please look at this 'cause I couldn't figure it out, you know."
I,Clear Problem Flagging,"So I think for takeoff is a software should be able to tell you the areas they they couldn't take data. And we found problem here. Please look at it. Everything else you can trust, but don't trust this."
I,Quality Control Features,"It's telling the design team. You can add more things or you can take things out to be within budget. OK, so by the time we get to 65%, we call that the point of no return."
I,Research Capabilities,"Yeah, I would say I use AII. Use a AI for research, right? I use a ChatGPT for research and... It's about knowing what what questions to ask, right?"
I,Prompt Engineering Importance,"If you're gonna use AI, make sure you're asking AI the right questions and giving AI the right prompts... The more data you feed to it, the the more accuracy you get out of it."
I,Educational Applications,"So I would if I was someone designing a construction management curriculum for students to learn, I would like to see their prompts, OK... Because then if, if if you're asking the right questions, you're gonna get the right answer, right?"
I,Budgeting Support for MEP Trades,So it would be nice if an AI could... Evaluate a set of drawings for mechanical. And calculate all the balancing they need to do for them. Based on the building size.
I,Historical Data Integration,"Everything that we bid for for schools is public... AI pulls all that data and pulls the cost... So you can trust that, but you need to... You need to ask the right questions, you know."
I,RS Means Reliability Issues,"And it's like 30% difference. You know it's not reliable. So so having an AI tool that could help them during budgeting, that would be my my number one recommendation. If anybody's developing an AI software."
I,Trade Coverage Validation,Or what trades did I not invite based on the spec book? Cause the spec book tells you on the table of contents everything that's in the job. 
J,Trust and Reliability Concerns,"Are you able to trust the accuracy of that technology? I think is at that point now, at least for our, for our purposes, I'm sure there are companies out there that have fully instituted those processes. We're just not not quite there yet."
J,Manual Verification Still Required,But then there's the process to go back and double check it just to make sure that it didn't miss anything or or that it didn't add something that doesn't really apply to what the submittal should be.
J,Accuracy as Primary Factor for Adoption,"How how reliable is the software? Can it be proven that you know it's not gonna? It's not going to like if you rely on it solely to put a bid together? For example, is there a huge piece of the scope that you're not has missed that you're account?"
J,Current Limited AI Integration,"Software program like Procore might have embedded AI with regard to and. I know there's a tool there that you can upload a spec book and press a button and then after a few processing iterations, it'll spit out a submit a log."
J,Integration with Existing Workflows,"So there's still some, you know, checks and balances that we have to go through, but that to the extent that we're utilizing that kind of technology."
J,Quantity Takeoff Automation Potential,"So those are a couple challenges I would say where they're and there probably is technology out there, especially on the quantity takeoff piece. That that can be very helpful for that. We just haven't have it instituted anything like that just yet on our side."
J,Efficiency Goals for Complete Trade Coverage,"But the challenge is, you know, I'd like to get it to a point where on any project we undertake, we're doing quantity takeoffs on most all of the trades within it because that that serves as a great tool to, you know, checks and balances with what your Subs."
J,Ease of Use as Primary Requirement,"It has to be easy to use. I guess is the probably the main thing, right? 'Cause, we've got a a wide variety of. Age demographic within our department."
J,Interface Accessibility Across Demographics,"So even even folks that may not be as cutting edge on the technology, I count myself in that some degree 'cause I they're young folks in hallways that do amazing things with technology that I couldn't even. Dream of learning to do, but some of that is as long as the interface is practical and efficient, and it's easy to use."
J,Process Adaptability Requirements,"If it's, if it's easily adaptable with our own processes, reliable and easy to use, I think those are the kind of like the the three key factors there for us."
J,Software Focus vs. Multi-function Tools,"You know, it could be one of those things where it might be pretty good at all those things, but a hyper focus on one specific discipline. Within that laundry list might be better, a better software. Because if it does that job extremely well and it take it cuts, you know the amount of time we're going through plans, for example by three or four hours, five hours on a larger project or six, then then it's worth it, right."
J,Information Processing Challenges,"The best estimators would take, you know, sometimes you only afforded a day or two to review a complete set of documents before you weigh a determination on it. Just given time constraints and everything else. But you could have three weeks and find not enough time to really read. Every page read. Every note read every you know specification."
J,Document Analysis Tool Limitations,"I know there's programs out there. You know that that will claim to help you upload all the documents. And it spits out a summary for you or it's key highlights of keynotes here and there, which might be helpful to some degree, but you you definitely don't wanna rely on that 1000% as a crutch to to just trusting the information 100% just because it."
J,Project Context Switching Challenges,"Then you have challenges where if you have one person working on multiple projects, there's that mind shift that takes you from 1 project to another, you know where. You read some some detail. So on project A but project B doesn't have that. But it's fresh in your mind, so you kinda have to like set that you know, wall between A and B."
J,Scope Verification Needs,"And that leads to, you know, sometimes you're just missing small scope here and there. The hope is that you're not missing anything too large to make it."
J,Future Vision for Comprehensive AI Integration,"Like once they perfect. Hey, upload the set of plans and everything gets spit out on a report, even from a constructability for alternative products costing perspective. Or even just upload the set of plans. Here's all your units. Here's all your unit costs. Here's the total budget for this set of plans. You know, there it is."
J,Efficiency Measurement Focus,"1 tangible way we can is how long does it take to assemble a budget? If it takes 10 hours and this instituting this new process cuts it down in half, then then that's a very easily quantifiable way that we could measure that."
J,Complex Systems Estimation Challenges,"I would say like mechanical, electrical, plumbing systems from an in House perspective, you know those systems are getting a lot more complicated as far as have a sophisticated technology that's part of those systems. So and and code changes with energy codes and those kinds of things, A Cy. Pretty often, so just. Maintaining a keen eye and accuracy and cost estimating. From that component I would say like that mechanical, electrical, plumbing systems has been a bit of a bit of a challenge for us."
J,Technology Adoption Philosophy,"Oak's culture has always been such that, you know, we don't, we don't want to be the first. Adopter of of any newer technology because you know you can invest so much in that next big thing, but there's always an iteration of improvement upon that first. Technology, right? So we've always taken the we've always taken a culturally, we've always kind of had the mindset of, yeah, well, we're going to keep an eye on things that are introduced into the marketplace from a software perspective. But we're going to kind of keep an eye on it. See."
K,Real-time Cost Database Updates,"So actually that's a great segue for AI. I mean that would be awesome if you could get. Real time costs of things, but that's, you know it's it's very challenging obviously because you have material costs are always changing, labor costs are changing and so but that would be a great application."
K,Database Obsolescence Challenges,"Cost, we can't just rely on the database 'cause the database gets obsolete very quickly. And it's it's very difficult for us to update it."
K,Manual Verification Requirements,"The It's the estimators. You know we have to always check those unit costs. Cost, we can't just rely on the database 'cause the database gets obsolete very quickly."
K,Labor-Intensive Database Maintenance,"Yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, it comes down to our labor in our company like we would have to assign somebody probably full time to just constantly update cost in the database, you know, so it's not cost effective for us to do that."
K,Conceptual Estimating AI Potential,"I like to, you know, you have to fill the gaps and I think it's pretty relevant to like AI how, how could how could AI do that, you know?"
K,Automated Quantity Surveying Vision,I mean I'm thinking AI should be able to do quantity survey somehow.
K,Database Integration Benefits,"I mean again, like when it comes to a database of cost to me that would be. The real one of the most helpful benefits, if it could somehow. Provide unit cost, material cost, labor cost, equipment cost, whatever. Like a huge database that was constantly updated and accurate that as well as you know if it can start to do take off."
K,Historical Data System Integration,"I mean, if if say it's a massive whatever university or or they have, if they put their standards into like an AI chatbot or whatever, I don't. I don't know that much about it, but if their standards are in there and. I'm not sure how that would work, but a lot of upfront work. But yeah, that could be helpful."
K,Cost-Effectiveness Considerations,"I guess to me it would be, you know, does it provide value? Does it really provide value and is it that much more than what we currently use? Does it? You know, does it cut productivity costs way down? And you know that type of thing?"
K,Technology Investment Decision Factors,"Yeah, I mean, if it's, if it really works and it's worthwhile, you know, if it saves the company money plus it's a benefit to our clients."
K,Complex Material Selection Analysis,"Well, there's, you know, the variables just just on a number of flooring like just say it's, you know, LVT. There's, I don't know how many different manufacturers just say 700 or 800. So a lot of times we get questions from architects. Well, what if I use this one instead of this one? You know how much will I save? You know, so it's impossible for us to keep all that information. Updated and current."
K,Comprehensive Cost Optimization,"So if that was something that could be analyzed in AI, to me that would be mind blowing. You could get the best, you know, most cost effective. And building."
K,Information Organization Challenges,"Yeah, that would be a good idea, because there's always, like, you know, some of these universities have that information, but they don't know where it is. Yeah. Or they or there's so much of it that if they got it to us, it would take us forever to go through it."
K,Market Condition Variables,"That's a variable that will never be able to really estimate, you know. At the end of the day it it's supply and demand."
K,Conceptual Phase Information Gaps,"It's it's lack of information, lack of people's time to. To communicate, I mean generally it's it's good if if we have questions. You know, the design team will will help us to the best they can, but they don't always have all the answers. So we have to fill the gaps."
K,Vendor Standards and Specifications,"Sometimes some of these owners, they want to go with a standard. They want all Otis elevators in there on their campus, so we need to know those things beforehand so we can make sure that we get the appropriate cost in the estimate for that."
K,Future Industry Evolution Uncertainty,"Half of me says it's probably going to be similar to what it is now 'cause I I guess I don't know enough about the AI. Is that really going to be a game changer or not? I I don't know but. To some extent, I think it would be, you know, some of the technology is is just going to keep evolving, but you always need the human input."
L,Addressing Current Accuracy Challenges,"Is this perfect? No, but is it for? We've got over like 1000 questions that we've generated for Constructability review. And so for us to have a person go through the set of drawings and do that... would take days."
L,Building Custom Training Models,So we we actually have a checklist that we built and it's it's almost too much and we were like you know the design team really is responsible for making sure that all of this is correct... But by doing this we can upload all of this into chess EPT and it can do it in an hour rather than it taking us days to do it.
L,Cost Accuracy Validation,"And I back checked it and I'm like these costs are actually pretty pretty accurate. So yeah, for stuff like that. I mean, it would have probably taken me, you know, an hour to set it up in the estimating software, put all the parameters in, put in all the sizes, all that stuff."
L,Workflow Integration Challenges,We're still trying to figure out what's the best syntax to write into ChatGPT so that it reads it right... What is the best file format for the Excel file and then what is and then how? How much drawings do we put in?
L,Software Ecosystem Integration,Product key numbers that integrate with our estimating software. So that we can quickly export out of togal and import into our estimating software.
L,Processing Optimization,"See what I did is I put it all in one time and it just it took a really long time. Whereas if you do it more strategically in smaller bytes and pieces, it does seem to work a little bit better."
L,Meeting Automation Success,"This is the the most powerful AI note taker I've seen, even as a standalone AI note taker... it incorporates and then I can have all my my notes that I take in the meeting on my own too... it also brings in all the action items that come out of the meeting."
L,3D Visualization for Client Communication,"You can put heights in and things like that and generate actual 3D visuals in togal, which are really nice for visualization. We've used those as visualization tools for owners, you know, hey, this is... these are your columns."
L,Drawing Comparison Tools,"It does have a cool feature that allows for you to overlay drawings, so it does the overlay comparisons all through AI... That would be something that would be awesome for procore to have or for... if they if they could have AI do that for you, you just put the drawings in and does it for you."
L,Future Visualization Technology,"I saw and this was probably 8 years ago was, you know, Microsoft HoloLens... you could actually see the plans in front of you... workers wearing, you know, virtual or augmented reality glasses so that they weren't working. But then they can actually see what the building's going to look like... they can see where the stud is and they can just put the stud there."
L,File Management Improvements,"Togal just came out with a feature a couple weeks ago... when you bring the drawings in now, it automatically detects the page number and it detects the page. Name and it automatically names all those... this is incredible."
L,Customizable Question Databases,"If, if, if there was a way that I could enter, I could build a database of my questions, right? That we've built, which are extremely robust and then have a tool do an overlay and generate overlay reports and then also... Review the drawings based on the questions that were asked."
L,Processing Limitations,"And then you can't really edit the report like their report, whereas with ChatGPT I can have it export into an Excel and then I can put the filter on it and then I can clean up the data that I need to in there."
L,Cost-Effectiveness vs. Specialized Tools,"It's like $2500. Per project... And so with ChatGPT at $30.00 a month, we can run multiple projects and get you know... Almost kind of similar results."
L,Platform Limitations and Guardrails,"And the other thing too is you gotta be real careful with copilot because you know, if you don't have your everything set up perfectly, it can pull data like people's salaries within the company... So that's the other part with copilot is it's like you really have to put up all the guardrails and the security."
L,Scalability Through Monthly Licensing,"I think we pay like $25.00 a month for five people... So you know, so it's it's it's pretty reasonable."
L,Comprehensive Constructability Review Solution,There's such a huge need for it for constructability review because there isn't a tool. I haven't found a really firmes is the closest thing and it's it's lacking a few things and it's not... It doesn't allow you to put your own questions in and ChatGPT does.
L,Industry-Wide AI Adoption Strategy,So we have... We have started doing. A monthly meeting to talk about AI... So one of the biggest things that we're trying to control is instead of everybody using. A bunch of different tools for AI because there's a lot of them out there and some of them don't have the guard rails on them.
L,Future of Construction Technology,"I think AI is definitely gonna make a change. You know, I'm already seeing software that can generate full architectural drawings from prompts, you know, and the drawings look pretty pretty amazing... I think it's gonna take. I think it's gonna help on code review. For permitting."
L,Conceptual Estimation Advancement,"You know, for us doing conceptual estimates. Quickly is still like one of my top things... They're gonna have that that conceptual. AI modeling that you can just basically. Basically, type in on a prompt and it will actually build the model and build the estimate."
