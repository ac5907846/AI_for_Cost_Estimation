Therefore, this study aims to focus on the cost estimation of prefabricated construction as the research object. This research aims to enhance the accuracy of total project cost estimation for general contractors, ultimately leading to improved profitability. Design/methodology/approach: This study used Vensim PLE software to establish a system dynamics model. In the modeling process, a systematic research review was used to identify cost-influencing factors; ABC classification and the analytic hierarchy process were used to score and determine the weights of influencing factors. Findings: The total cost error obtained by the model is less than 2% compared with the actual value. It can be used to cost estimation and analysis. The analysis results indicate that there are 7 key factors, among which the prefabrication rate has the most significant impact. Furthermore, the model can provide the extreme range cost; the minimum cost can reduce by 13% from the value in the case. The factor's value can compose a cost control strategy for general contractors. Practical implications: The cost of prefabricated buildings can be estimated well, and deciding the prefabrication rate is crucial. The cost can be declined by correct cost control strategies when bidding and subcontracting are in process. The strategies can follow the direction of the model. Originality/value: A systemic, quantitative and qualitative analysis of cost estimation of prefabricated buildings for general contractors has been conducted. A mathematical model has been developed and validated to facilitate more effective cost-control measures. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This study explores the effectiveness, mechanism, and economic viability of remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soil by hydrazine. Soil-phase batch kinetic experiments were performed to examine the feasibility of reducing Cr(VI) while finding the effects of relevant process parameters, such as initial Cr(VI) concentration, hydrazine dosage, pH, soil-to-water ratio, and temperature. The materials were thoroughly characterized to gain insight into the mechanism. TCLP tests were done to affirm the immobilization stability. Complete Cr(VI) reduction was achieved within 3 h using a moderate 326% excess of hydrazine at neutral pH. Sonication of the soil mixed with hydrazine using a probe-type sonicator accelerated the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Kinetic data could be adequately fitted in a second-order rate model, where the rate constant shows a linear dependency on the soil-to-water ratio. Additionally, the logarithmic rate constant demonstrates linearity within the pH range. The leaching toxicity of Cr(VI) and Crtotal complied with the USEPA regulatory limit and remained stable for 75 d. Hydrazine alone and its combination with ultrasound are sustainable and economically feasible for effective remediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated soil. The statistical analysis using RSM indicated a 99.4% reduction, aligning closely with the calculated optimized value. The optimal process conditions are easy to implement for field application at a competitive cost compared to other reductants. A simplified economic analysis was done to check the competitive acceptability of the technique, considering the construction cost of the remediation plant and its daily operational and maintenance expenses. The results show that the proposed technique will be a competitive one for field applications for the remediation of soil contaminated with Cr(VI). The data and kinetic rate equation will be useful for the process design of the remediation of soil contaminated with Cr(VI). © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Implementing well-structured strategies and programmes to make these settlements safer and more sustainable for residents is a challenge for governments. Therefore, it is crucial to define models to accurately predict the costs of intervention and assess the economic feasibility of slum upgrading actions. The aim of this paper is first to define possible intervention scenarios for the informal city and then to characterise an innovative model for the rapid estimation of related construction costs. The model, based on a synthetic-comparative evaluation procedure, allows estimating the urban regeneration costs of a slum according to the intervention scenario, which is differentiated into minimal, barely satisfactory, and fully satisfactory levels. This provides economic actors and policy makers with the essential financial terms to determine the resources to be allocated to support slums. The model is applied to the case study of Kibera (Nairobi), one of the most challenged slums in the world. The results provide a measure of the transformation costs per capita. These costs turn out to be insignificant compared to the expected economic and social benefits in the long run. Copyright © 2025 Nesticò, Russo, Maselli and Vietri."

Generating a practical and safe lift plan significantly impacts the successful delivery of such projects. This paper introduces an integrated crane planning and lift scheduling framework for managing multiple concurrent mobile cranes' operations. The presented framework is built upon recently developed crane planning and optimization systems. It aims to balance four primary areas of project management (time, cost, quality, and safety) through schedule enhancement, cost estimation, and risk mitigation. This approach leads to a more practical lift plan. Automating the process of detecting logical issues and satisfying the constraints in the lift planning process helps to improve time efficiency and reduce errors. This paper also scrutinizes crane operations to provide a realistic budget and schedule. The developed lift planning system is flexible and practical, as validated by its successful implementation in several real modular projects in North America. © 2024"

The processes for documenting, exchanging, and updating data constitute one of the principal administrative challenges being currently confronted by the construction project management. As a consequence of the continued reliance on paper-based processes evidenced in the Iraqi businesses and construction projects, a considerable volume of documentation is likely to accumulate, thereby increasing the complexity and time required for specific data to be retrieved. In this study, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) models were used to document projects by employing the MATLAB-Revit software. The findings demonstrate that the project timeline is also recorded because it is related to the suggested model, which is designed to produce an effective model that mimics reality. A comparative analysis of the data pertaining to the foundations, columns, walls (24 cm and 12 cm), floors, and slabs of four multi-story buildings, was conducted. This analysis was divided into three categories: estimated, SVM-BIM, and actual documentation. The findings indicated that the proposed model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in predicting the material quantities required in building construction. These values were found to be in close proximity to, and aligned with, the actual documentation. © by the authors."

Software project management requires an accurate evaluation of software development's effort, time, and cost, often underestimated or overestimated. So far, methodology has yet to accurately and reliably estimate the cost of software development. To overcome this issue, this paper proposed a constructive rapid application development model based on software cost effort and time estimation approach (CORADMO-based CETA) for accurate software cost estimation. The data requirements, cost drivers, constraints, and priorities are given as input to the fuzzy inference system (FIS). The processed output, such as effort, time, and cost for the nominal plan, shortest schedule plan, and least cost plan, is computed in the FIS. To reduce the effort, time, and cost, the output is optimized by dragonfly whale lion optimization (DWLO), which provides the best-estimated effort, time, and cost as an output for software development. The proposed CORADMO-based CETA model is tested in the NASA 93 dataset using MATLAB. The performance of the CORADMO-based CETA method is measured in terms of Pred (25 %), magnitude of relative error, and mean magnitude of relative error, attaining the values of 80.72 %, 87.94 %, and 98.13 %, respectively. Finally, the CORADMO-based CETA model justifies the suitability of dragonfly whale lion optimization with the proposed fuzzy logic. © 2024, Publishing House of the Romanian Academy.

Regarding environmental performance, the use of GFRP instead of steel can lead to a significant reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, thus containing the environmental impact during their life cycle and contributing to the energy transition. From a structural point of view, the high corrosion resistance and durability of GFRP structures minimise maintenance requirements and greatly extend their lifespan, which can even be considered unlimited, even in terms of reusability. This paper jointly evaluates for the first time the structural performance and economic viability of industrial constructions made from GFRP pultruded profiles. These performances are then compared with that of equivalent steel constructions. This is done through a standardised and exportable model based on life cycle cost (LCC) which is developed in four phases: (1) technical-mechanical properties and structural analysis of the buildings; (2) modelling and cost estimation; (3) evaluation of the LCC indicator; (4) performance comparison of design alternatives. The elaborations show that industrial GFRP structures, while having a higher investment cost than equivalent steel constructions, can guarantee lower maintenance costs in the long run. Interesting quantitative results are: (i) the construction cost of the GFRP structure exceeds that of the steel structure by about 15%; (ii) maintenance costs are much higher in the steel structure than in the GFRP structure, due to the greater susceptibility to corrosion of structural steel; (iii) in relation to its very high durability, the residual value of GFRP structures coincides with the construction cost, while the residual value of steel structures decreases significantly; (iv) the composite structure has a Global Cost less than 26% of that of the steel structure, being the most economically advantageous alternative considering the costs related to the whole life cycle, also confirming itself as a fairer and more accessible alternative. The proposed Life Cycle Cost-based model can find multiple applications in the field of civil engineering as a valid support for the selection between alternative structural materials, useful for the transition to a more circular, just, and sustainable construction industry. © 2024"

Estimating the steel structure cost of industrial buildings is a challenging task compared with traditional buildings due to the uniqueness of this class of projects. This paper aims to introduce an effective and accurate parametric model for construction cost estimation of industrial steel structures. The paper proposes a regression-based model for estimating the cost of a critical construction component: the industrial steel structure where the is not enough historical data is available. The factors that affect the construction cost of industrial steel structures are initially identified based on the literature and interviews with local experts. The correlation between input factors and model’s output is then investigated. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the relative importance of the regression model’s inputs. The model is validated using actual data on industrial steel structure costs in Saudi Arabia. The model adequately predicted the construction costs of actual projects with an accuracy of more than 88%. This indicates that the model is capable of accurately predicting the cost of such structures. The proposed model can be of great assistance to investors and decision-makers looking to invest in the industrial sector. © 2024 The Author(s)."

This study focuses on the production (A1–A3) and construction (A4–A5) stages, omits the use and disposal phases, and extensively examines the material components and their environmental implications. It evaluates the environmental impact of diverse column types. Revit 2022 (Autodesk®) is used to model scenarios with steel-to-concrete ratios of 1.2 %, 1.5 %, and 1.8 %. The most cost-effective steel-to-concrete ratio is 1.2 %, which reduces the embodied carbon and energy by 32 % and 35 %, respectively. A steel-to-concrete ratio of 1.8 % increases the embodied carbon and energy by 13 % and 14 %, respectively, compared with the base case. This indicates the significant contributions of concrete and steel to the embodied carbon and energy during the production stages. This study emphasizes the diminishing cost effectiveness of increasing the steel ratio beyond 1.2 % and highlights the importance of balancing steel usage and cost efficiency in column construction. © 2024 The Author(s)"

This paper constructs an intelligent building engineering cost estimation model that combines subtractive clustering, a self-learning mechanism, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to address this problem. In the data preprocessing stage, subtractive clustering is applied to optimize multimodal data, screen key features, and eliminate redundant information. Subsequently, the model parameters are dynamically adjusted according to the error feedback through a self-learning mechanism to improve its adaptability to diverse construction projects. In the feature extraction and estimation stage, the CNN module is combined to extract deep features from images, texts, and numerical data to achieve high-precision estimation. The experimental results show that the model in this paper outperforms traditional methods in terms of MSE (mean-square error), MAE (mean absolute error), R2 (coefficient of determination), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), with the mean values being 73.18, 8.33, 0.9477, and 5.33%, respectively.

A four-stage research method was employed: (1) identification of BIM uses relevant to road projects, (2) determination of principal causes contributing to scheduling deficiencies, (3) cross-impact analysis to quantify BIM’s influence on these deficiencies, and (4) expert interviews to characterize key BIM uses. Results highlight that 4D construction planning, quantity take-off and cost estimation, and traffic management planning positively impact road scheduling, reducing errors in work breakdown structures, resource allocation, and coordination between project stakeholders. BIM streamlines communication, supports proactive risk management, and enables real-time schedule adjustments by providing an integrated digital environment.

This study compared these three different models, focusing on costs, and implementation in each vaccination strategy. A cross-sectional study, conducted during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign from January 1 to 20, 2021, utilized a questionnaire to collect data on vaccination sites and conducted a random sample costs analysis of three models. Data on costs, including construction, materials, labor, and operations, were gathered through interviews and field surveys to understand resource utilization and personnel involvement in vaccination activities. Beijing's COVID-19 vaccination campaign involved 580 locations administering 1,829,324 doses. The numbers of vaccination clinics, mass vaccination centers, and door-to-door service were 233, 137, and 210. The total doses administered at vaccination clinics, mass vaccination centers, and door-to-door service numbered 465,721 (25.5 %), 991,444 (54.2 %), and 372,159 (20.3 %), respectively. The median daily doses administered at vaccination clinics, mass vaccination centers, and door-to-door service were 124, 453, and 540, respectively. The daily costs of the vaccination clinic, mass vaccination center, and door-to-door service were $4644.1, $22,746.5, and $4109.6, respectively, and the costs per dose were $12.9, $10.5, and $7.4, respectively. We concluded that there are significant variations in costs and efficiency across the three vaccination models. We must comprehensively consider the available regional resources, the target population for vaccination, the expected vaccination effect, and other factors to choose an appropriate vaccination model. © 2025 The Authors"

Estimating the performance of roadheaders is crucial for planning and cost estimation when planning tunnel or tunnel projects. The aim of this study is to derive generalized performance prediction models including Schmidt hammer value, needle penetration index, and volumetric joint count for roadheaders used in coal mines. The performance measurements of axial and transverse type roadheaders were carried out in six different coal mines. Schmidt hammer tests, needle penetration index tests, and of volumetric joint count measurements were also performed at the locations where the performance measurements were conducted. The extensive data were evaluated using multiple linear and nonlinear regression analysis. The developed formulas were evaluated using statistical tests. The Equations that include the Schmidt hammer value or needle penetration index value in addition to cutter head power have been shown to be unreliable. However, the equations that include Schmidt hammer value or needle penetration index value in addition to cutterhead power and volumetric joint count have been shown to be reliable.

This research aimed to help buildings construction project stakeholders in Iraq to improve the accuracy of preliminary buildings project cost estimations based on the initial information available and historical buildings project data to evaluate a future project’s feasibility. A literature review of topics related to preliminary cost estimation, particularly buildings projects and factors affecting their cost, informed development of an integrated mathematical model based on a support vector machine to facilitate preliminary cost estimation during early buildings construction project planning utilizing relevant factors from both old and new projects (i.e., total floor area of buildings, construction duration, total number of floors, average floor height, location index, project quality standards, project complexity, and facilities provision). To enhance accuracy, the final cost forecasting model was modified using an inflation rate impact scenario to account for any future economic effects on anticipated building costs. This study concluded that the dominant factors behind cost variations between similar projects over different periods, and thus the primary factors for building cost estimation, are building area, average floor height, and number of floors. Thus, this study contributes to enhancing best practice in cost estimating for building construction projects in the pre-design, early planning phase, enabling decision makers to plan alternative options to enhance decisions on feasibility within the project’s constraints. Novelty arises from the features of the input factors used for the developed model to determine the preliminary budget required in the early planning stage taking into account construction sector inflation values for the following period.

However, the current industry practice typically involves separate modeling by design and cost estimation units, leading to imperfect conversions between design models and quantity models, making it difficult to achieve multi-use of a single model. In light of this, this paper explores a method for quantity extraction based on the Revit design software, which holds practical significance for integrating design and calculation, thereby facilitating optimal design. First, this paper compares Revit with the Revit-based Chenxi BIM software and other mainstream domestic BIM 3D quantity extraction software in terms of interaction methods, interaction characteristics, and software advantages and disadvantages. By utilizing the Revit API for secondary development, Visual Studio was chosen as the development environment, and C# as the programming language to read Revit data. A calculation plugin based on the Revit platform was designed, successfully extending and optimizing Revit's quantity extraction functions, enabling the automatic extraction of quantities from design models. The development of the plugin includes various aspects such as plugin framework definition, user interface design, data model processing, view display, tool functions, error handling, and log recording. It supports localized resource management, Revit command processing, and Excel export functionality. By comparing the quantity extraction results of a building model using this plugin with those calculated by the Chenxi BIM software, the error was found to be less than 1.5%, verifying the practicality and accuracy of the plugin. © 2025 SPIE."

Estimation variation from actuals presents a problem when attempting to complete a project on planned time and budget. Various studies cover project performance monitoring with different cost and time performance indices. Nevertheless, project monitoring techniques do not take advantage of the available data to assess the performance and accuracy of estimates developed by the estimation team. Design/methodology/approach: This research proposes using statistical process control (SPC) to assess the consistency and stability of the estimation of activities’ costs and durations. The proposed system calculates the deviation of the estimated costs and durations from the actual values. These calculations are the activities’ indices that are used to plot the control chart. The process capability analysis (PCA) is used to determine the accuracy deviation of the estimations from the organization’s targets. Findings: Results of the proposed system application to a real project determine the activities that have inaccurate cost and duration estimations. This result helps the estimation departments to analyze reasons for inaccurate estimations. The proposed system is an easy, effective tool for continuous improvement to the performance of the estimation department. Originality/value: Some projects are classified as troubled projects when calculating the status of the project with reference to estimations, while the estimations themselves are troubled and need to be corrected.

However, traditional estimation methods often struggle to handle complex, nonlinear relationships inherent in construction datasets. This study proposes a process innovation by systematically evaluating six machine learning (ML) models, i.e., Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, and CatBoost, on a standardized RSMeans dataset comprising 4,477 real-world construction data points. The primary aim is to benchmark the predictive performance, generalizability, and stability of both linear and ensemble models in construction cost forecasting. Each model is subjected to rigorous hyperparameter tuning using grid search with 5-fold cross-validation. Performance is assessed using R² (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root mean squared error), and MBE (mean bias error), while confidence intervals are computed to quantify predictive uncertainty. Results indicate that linear models achieve modest accuracy (R² ≈ 0.83), but struggle to model nonlinear interactions. In contrast, ensemble-based models outperform significantly, i.e., XGBoost and CatBoost achieve R² values of 0.988 and 0.987, respectively, RMSE values below 0.5, and near-zero MBE. Moreover, confidence interval visualization and feature importance analysis provide transparency and interpretability, enhancing the models’ practical applicability. Unlike prior studies that compare models in isolation, this work introduces a unified, interpretable framework and highlights the trade-offs between accuracy, overfitting, and deployment readiness. The findings have real-world implications for contractors, project managers, and cost engineers seeking reliable, data-driven decision support systems.

The cost estimation process uses two main parameters, but the main goal is to create a cost estimation model. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores a flexible model design that uses computing capabilities for decision-making. Using cost optimization techniques, the model can select an optimal pedestrian bridge system based on multiple criteria that may change independently. This research focuses on four types of SPB systems prevalent in Egypt and worldwide. The study also suggests developing a computerized cost and weight optimization model that enables decision-makers to select the optimal system for SPBs in keeping up with the criteria established for that system. Findings: In this paper, the authors developed an optimization model for cost estimates of SPBs. The model considers two main parameters: weight and cost. The main contribution of this study based on a parametric study is to propose an approach that enables structural engineers and designers to select the optimum system for SPBs. Practical implications: The implications of this research from a practical perspective are that the study outlines a feasible approach to develop a computerized model that utilizes the capabilities of computing for quick cost optimization that enables decision-makers to select the optimal system for four common SPBs based on multiple criteria that may change independently and in concert with cost optimization during the preliminary design stage. Social implications: The model can choose an optimal system for SPBs based on multiple criteria that may change independently and in concert with cost optimization. The resulting optimization model can forecast the optimum cost of the SPBs for different structural spans and road spans based on local unit costs of materials cost of steel structures, fabrication, erection and painting works. Originality/value: The authors developed a computerized model that uses spreadsheet software's capabilities for cost optimization, enabling decision-makers to select the optimal system for SPBs meeting the criteria established for such a system. Based on structural characteristics and material unit costs, this study shows that using the optimization model for estimating the total direct cost of SPB systems, the project cost can be accurately predicted based on the conceptual design status, and positive prediction outcomes are achieved. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Cost breakdown analysis (CA) is one of the most essential tasks of estimating a construction cost accurately, and this task relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of cost estimators. However, in practice, CA is not effectively performed because of limited time for implementing an analysis, lack of required knowledge by cost estimators, and unorganized knowledge of cost estimators. Studies have also rarely discussed construction cost estimation from the perspective of CA. This paper thus proposes a novel framework that includes representation and reasoning functionalities for addressing these practical and research limitations. The proposed framework is based on ontological modeling that enables organizing CA knowledge systematically, connecting it semantically, and retrieving it inferentially. A case study was performed for validating the framework. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances conventional CA by efficiently and effectively identifying essential information about CA items and their unit prices, generating CA sheet templates, and ensuring that all necessary CA items are accounted for. Its representation and reasoning capabilities can enhance the organization and retrieval of cost estimators’ knowledge, facilitate cost estimation, and thus overcome limitations present in traditional CA processes. © 2025 The Chinese Institute of Engineers."

To address these problems, this study proposes a novel method that integrates the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets for intelligent cost prediction. Given that engineering unit prices are significantly and dynamically uncertain due to multi-source heterogeneous factors (e.g., seasonal fluctuations, regional differences, and market volatility), we construct a transformation mechanism of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. This mechanism expands the traditional deterministic engineering feature matrix into an information matrix that includes hesitation degrees and membership degrees, thereby achieving a refined representation of uncertain parameters. On this basis, we introduce a multi-dimensional similarity matching algorithm to establish an accurate mapping relationship between the project under construction and the historical case library. A weighted correction prediction model based on similar cases is proposed to enhance the robustness of unit cost prediction results. Verification through multiple engineering examples demonstrates that this method provides a new prediction paradigm for engineering cost estimation, combining both theoretical rigor and practical applicability.

This system uses UAVs to capture high-resolution images, which are then processed by the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for instance segmentation. The YOLOv7 model, fine-tuned with the Pilgrimage Walk Optimization (PWO)-Lite algorithm, achieved the highest accuracy, recording a 65.6 % mAP50 on the testing set. The PWO-Lite algorithm enhanced the YOLOv7's performance, increasing mean average precision by 4.1 % compared to YOLOv7 with augmented images and 13.9 % compared to YOLOv7 using original photos. These improvements significantly boost the model's generalization capability.

A critical element for every construction undertaking's accomplishment is cost evaluation. Precisely approximating the cost of a project involves thorough consideration of various elements, making it a difficult undertaking to forecast. Several building constructions nowadays produce high cost overrun because of unforeseen change in the project budget that raises the overall project cost such as the complexity of the building system and the organization’s environment. The aim of this paper is to offer a potential prediction for cost estimation, with the goal of minimizing the substantial risk of cost overruns in low- to mid-rise buildings. In this study, the structural elements for low- to mid-rise buildings were utilized from building constructions, such as the number of exterior walls (QEW), type of construction material (TCM), building height (HB), total gross area (TGA), building footprint area (BFA), type of occupancy (TO), number of floors (NF), quantity of shear walls (QSW), and number of columns (NC); an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed in this research to establish a model for forecasting the total construction cost (TCC). With a correlation value (R) of 0.999890 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.601%, the modeling results shown that the best model structure was 9-25-1 (input-hidden-output), indicating its effectiveness and efficacy in forecasting the TCC. The impact of each variable employed as an input variable (IV) in the model establishment was seen employing the connection weights (CW) through Garson’s algorithm (GA). The calculation exhibited the order of influence observed as QSW > NC > HB > NF > QEW > TGA > BFA > TO > TCM, wherein the quantity of the shear walls is seen to have the most contribution to the construction cost. Moreover, to check its performance versus other prediction modeling tools, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was also created and compared to the governing prediction model (GPM). The MAPE of the BP-NN is 7.108 times better than that of the created MLR model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025."

Early cost prediction for a construction project is the basic approach to procure a project within a predefined budget. However, most of the projects routinely face the impact of cost overruns. Furthermore, conventional and manual cost computing techniques are hectic, time-consuming and error-prone. To deal with such challenges, soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms are applied in construction management. Each technique has its own constraints not only in terms of efficiency but also in terms of feasibility, practicability, reliability and environmental impacts. However, appropriate combination of the techniques improves the model owing to their inherent nature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a hybrid model by combining machine learning (ML) techniques with ANN to accurately predict the cost of pile foundations. The parameters contributing toward the cost of pile foundations were collected from five different projects in India. Out of 180 collected data entries, 176 entries were finally used after data cleaning. About 70% of the final data were used for building the model and the remaining 30% were used for validation. Findings: The proposed model is capable of predicting the pile foundation costs with an accuracy of 97.42%. Originality/value: Although various cost estimation techniques are available, appropriate use and combination of various ML techniques aid in improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed model will be a value addition to cost estimation of pile foundations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The real estate industry is characterized by high costs, high profit and high risks. The schedules of real estate projects are also characterized by having large number of repetitive activities that are executed over a long duration. The repetitiveness, long duration of execution, the high amounts of money involved and the high risk made it desirable to leverage the impact of changes in phasing plans on net present value of amounts incurred and received over the long execution and selling duration. This also changes the project progress, and delivery time as well as their respective impact on customer degree of satisfaction. This research addresses the problem of selecting the best phasing alternative for real estate development projects while maximizing customer satisfaction and project profit. Design/methodology/approach: The research proposes a model that generates all construction phasing alternatives and performs decision-making to rank all possible phasing alternatives. The proposed model consists of five modules: (1) Phasing Sequencing module, (2) Customer Satisfaction module, (3) Cash-In calculation module, (4) Cost Estimation module and (5) Decision-making module. A case study was presented to demonstrate the practicality of the model. Findings: The proposed model satisfies the real estate market's need for proper construction phasing plans evaluation and selection against the project's main success criteria, customer satisfaction and project profit. The proposed model generates all construction phasing alternatives and performs multi-criteria decision making to rank all possible phasing alternatives. It quantifies the score of the two previously mentioned criteria and ranks all solutions according to their overall score. Research limitations/implications: The research proposes a model that assist real estate market's need for proper construction phasing plans evaluation and selection against the project's main success criteria, customer satisfaction and project profit. The proposed model can be used to conclude general guidelines and common successful practices to be used by real estate developers when deciding the construction phasing plan. In this study the model is based on business models where all the project units are sold, rental cases are not considered. Also, the budget limitations that might exist when phasing is not considered in the model computations. Originality/value: The model can be used as a complete platform that can hold all real estate project data, process revenues and cost information for estimating profit, plotting cash flow profiles, quantifying the degree of customer satisfaction attributable to each phasing alternative and providing recommendation showing the best one. The model can be used to conclude general guidelines and common successful practices to be used by real estate developers when tackling the challenge of selecting construction phasing plans. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

First, parametric data research was conducted, including 180 examples of foundation systems for high-rise building models related to criteria such as average column spacing, floor height, slap load, overall weight, base shear, and over. In addition, moment, gravity load, seismic load, design load, various columns (mid-edge-corner), soil profile, bearing capacity, GWT, excavation depth, and foundation systems are all factors to consider (shallow and deep footing). The research encompassed column spacing (5.0, 7.0, and 9.0 m) and the number of stories from 15 to 35, with an average cost decrease of 15%. The AI model utilizes extensive machine learning algorithms to analyze structural and geotechnical parameters. It provides a predictive tool that improves decision-making in the preliminary design. The methodology includes collecting data, training models utilizing innovative neural network techniques and validating them against current cost estimation models. The findings indicate that the AI model significantly improves the accuracy of cost estimations, with a precision rate of 95%, compared to traditional methods. Moreover, the model presents a potential cost savings of up to 15%.

However, there are no identifiable accurate post-earthquake cost estimation mechanisms. This has led to major deviations between the initial and final construction costs. For example, the estimated cost of repair of the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence changed from 41 billion NZD to $53 billion NZD (adjusted for inflation). Previous research identified eleven factors that specifically impact post-earthquake cost estimation. The recognisable literature was unable to identify a post-earthquake cost estimation model that considers these factors. Therefore, this research aims to fill this gap by developing and validating the cost of damage repair (including refurbishment) and the Earthquake Estimation Model (C-DREEM) framework. The C-DREEM framework was developed based on previous literature and inputs from a development team that included eleven industry professionals. The developed framework was then verified through a focus group interview consisting of nine professionals. The research developed and verified a framework for cost estimation for earthquake damage repair work, C-DREEM, that impacts earthquake damage repair work.

In the building construction sector, generating a precise and trustworthy cost estimate before building begins is the greatest challenge. Emphasizing the value of using ANN models to forecast the total cost of a building renovation project is the ultimate objective. As a result, building firms may be able to avoid financial losses as long as there is as little discrepancy between projected and actual costs for remodeling works in progress. To address the gap in the research, Greek contractors specializing in building renovations provided a sizable dataset of real project cost data. To build cost prediction ANNs, the collected data had to be organized, assessed, and appropriately encoded. The network was developed, trained, and tested using IBM SPSS Statistics software 28.0.0.0. The dependent variable is the final cost. The independent variables are initial cost, estimated completion time, actual completion time, delay time, initial and final demolition-drainage costs, cost of expenses, initial and final plumbing costs, initial and final heating costs, initial and final electrical costs, initial and final masonry costs, initial and final construction costs of plasterboard construction, initial and final cost of bathrooms, initial and final cost of flooring, initial and final cost of frames, initial and final cost of doors, initial and final cost of paint, and initial and final cost of kitchen construction. The first procedure that was employed was the radial basis function (RBF). The efficiency of the RBFNN model was evaluated and analyzed during training and testing, with up to 6% sum of squares error and nearly 0% relative error in the training sample, which accounted for roughly 70% of the total sample. The second procedure implemented was the method called the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The efficiency of the MLPNN model was assessed and examined during training and testing; the training sample, which made up around 70% of the overall sample, had a relative error of 0–7% and a sum of squares error ranging from 1% to 5%, confirming specifically the efficacy of RBFNN in calculating the overall cost of renovations. © 2024 by the authors."

Background: Construction projects, particularly those with repetitive units like housing developments, face ongoing challenges in accurate scheduling and cost estimation. Traditional estimation methods often overlook the impact of learning effects, which can improve productivity and reduce costs as crews gain experience. Learning curve theory, widely applied in manufacturing, offers a framework to model these gains in construction settings. Integrating learning curves into project planning has the potential to enhance accuracy in forecasting timelines and budgets, ultimately improving project efficiency and resource management. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and apply a learning curve model to enhance scheduling and cost estimation in repetitive construction projects, particularly in a multi-unit housing project. Methods: By incorporating historical data and analyzing critical factors that impact project duration and cost, a more reliable forecasting model is developed. The learning curves are created using a three-point approach, supported by artificial neural networks (ANN) and the relative importance index (RII), to systematically assess cost divisions and influential project factors. Results: The results indicate that the learning curve model can achieve time savings of 27% and labor cost savings of 36% compared to traditional estimation methods that do not consider the effect of the learning curve in construction projects. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that learning curve models, combined with advanced data analysis techniques, provide a robust framework for optimizing project schedules and budgets, ultimately leading to more efficient resource utilization and cost-effective project outcomes. In other words, the study presented in this paper is significant as it can lead to improved project outcomes, cost savings, better resource management, and overall advancement in the construction industry's practices and competitiveness.

It starts with a systematic hypergraph formulation incorporating construction cost factors and their interrelationships. A hypergraph deep learning model is then developed based on the formulated hypergraph for end-to-end construction cost prediction. Afterwards, model interpretation is undertaken to reveal the cost factor importance from the model training results in a quantitative manner.

Traditional cost estimation methods struggle to meet the need for rapid and precise estimation due to the complexity inherent in their construction. To address this challenge, this study aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of cost estimation by innovatively developing an Adaptive Self-Explanatory Convolutional Neural Network (ASCNN) model, tailored to meet the specific cost estimation needs of replica traditional vernacular dwellings in the Huizhou region. The ASCNN model employs a Random Forest model to filter key features, inputs these into the CNN for cost estimation, and utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize parameters, thereby improving predictive accuracy. The decision-making process of the model is thoroughly interpreted through SHAP value analysis, ensuring credibility and transparency. During the construction of the ASCNN model, this study collected and analyzed bidding control price data from 98 replica traditional vernacular dwellings. The empirical results demonstrate that the ASCNN model exhibits outstanding predictive performance on the test set, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9828.06 yuan, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.6%, and a Coefficient of Determination (R2) as high as 0.989, confirming the model’s high predictive accuracy and strong generalization capability. Through SHAP value analysis, this study further identifies key factors such as floor plan layout, roof area, and column material coefficient that are central to cost prediction. The ASCNN model proposed in this study not only significantly improves the accuracy of cost estimation for Huizhou replica traditional vernacular dwellings, but also enhances its transparency and credibility through model interpretation methods, providing a reliable basis for related investment decisions.

These issues are often exacerbated by uncertainties in time and cost estimation outcomes. To address this, various models have been developed in recent years to enable probabilistic estimation for tunneling projects, considering uncertainties. However, the impact of uncertainties on the critical path and its implications on time and cost estimations have not been discussed explicitly and in detail for network underground structures encompassing multiple construction paths. In this study, we update the KTH time and cost estimation model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This updated model enables simultaneous round-by-round construction simulation across all paths in network underground structures. Consequently, it accommodates uncertainty in the critical path and its influence on time estimation outcomes. Additionally, the updated model introduces an innovative technique to model geological uncertainties along tunnel routes, thereby contributing to the field's diversity. Practical application of the updated model is showcased using the Uri Hearace tunnel as an illustrative example.

The results indicate that added items constitute 77% of change order costs. Furthermore, design phases contribute to 52% and 70% of the total change order costs for both schools. The responses from 165 participants emphasized five crucial factors: insufficient project evaluation before the design phase, subpar project management during implementation, price variations during execution compared with estimated costs, inadequate selection of subcontractors, and errors in estimation or insufficient cost estimation. The findings suggest that incorporating BIM technology in the design phases can cut change orders by half, resulting in a roughly 50% reduction in overall change order costs. Additionally, it improves project efficiency and accelerates the project timeline. The study pinpointed the factors driving increased change orders in Iraqi projects, stressing the need for early BIM adoption for comprehensive solutions. The emphasis on accurate estimation, site assessments, effective management, and meticulous verification is crucial. © 2024 Author(s)."

However, cost overruns are almost inevitable due to the risks inherent in construction projects. Hence, the completion cost fluctuates throughout the execution phase and requires periodic updates. There is a need for a prompt and user-friendly completion cost estimation model that accounts for fluctuating risk scores and their impacts on the total cost during the execution phase. Machine learning (ML) techniques could address these requirements by providing effective methods for tackling dynamic systems. The proposed approach aims to predict the cost overrun ratio classes of the completion cost according to the changes in the total risk scores at any time of the project. Six classification algorithms were utilized and validated by employing 110 data points from a globally operating construction company. The performances of the algorithms were evaluated with validation and performance indices. The decision tree classifier surpassed other algorithms. Although there are some research limitations, including risk perception, data gathering restrictions, and selecting proper ML algorithms upon data properties, this research improves the planning abilities of construction executives by providing a cost overrun ratio based on changing total risk scores, facilitating swift and simple assessments at any stage of a construction project’s execution. © 2024 by the authors."

The study considers qualitative and quantitative data to identify the most common causes of CCV through pre-tendering. A partial least square-structure model (PLS-SEM) procedure was used to develop a causal model and rank CCV factors based on their effect, partially based on prior survey raw data conducted in 2022 and the data from 94 projects. Construction industry experts assessed the prior five-year rate of BIM adoption on construction projects to infer the expected trend in BIM adoption in the future (until 2037). Based on the causal model of CCV factors and the future rates of BIM adoption, the dynamic impact of BIM on CCV factors over time was modeled and analyzed. The analysis shows that BIM reduces CCV over time by improving Estimator Performance (EP), Information Quality (IQ), and contractual procedure (CP). The results showed that the CP, EP, and EF have directly impacted CCV, and the PC and IQ indirectly affect the CCV.

Cost overruns pose a significant threat to the construction industry’s profitability. The potential benefits of recent advancements in machine learning (ML) models have not yet been fully utilized against such chronic threats. This research aims to lay the groundwork for the potential application of advanced ML techniques in predicting cost overruns by employing a broad set of ML algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: The features used to predict the cost overrun ratio in construction projects were extracted from relevant studies and available field data, resulting in 12 key features. The principle of “let the data speak for itself” was applied to this study, which employed atypical tools, specifically ML methodologies, to a dataset of 836 public projects. The prediction models were developed using 15 ML regression algorithms and then further evaluated and cross-validated. Findings: The CatBoost model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy on the test set (R2 = 0.883), followed closely by Stacking Regressor (R2 = 0.881). Other models with high accuracy included Voting Regressor (R2 = 0.867), XGBoost Regressor (R2 = 0.844), Gradient Boosting Regressor (R2 = 0.833), LGBM Regressor (R2 = 0.813) and Random Forest Regressor (R2 = 0.802). The predictive model identified three key factors in forecasting cost overruns: variation orders, which had the highest feature importance at 41.16%, followed by excessive quantities at 21.86% and budgeted costs at 20.96%. Research limitations/implications: The findings hold substantial implications for research, practice and society. The study validates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in forecasting cost overruns in construction projects through a comparative analysis of various ML algorithms. The investigation underscores the efficacy of the CatBoost algorithm and advocates for additional inquiry into machine learning applications within this domain. The CatBoost model, recognized as a top-performing machine learning model, serves as an effective and dependable tool for practitioners and project planners to predict cost overruns in construction projects. This promotes the advancement of data-informed cost estimation and management approaches, resulting in enhanced decision-making and minimized project risks. From a societal perspective, the capacity for accurate overrun predictions will guarantee the achievement of the desired project baseline. Consequently, the implementation of the research findings will lead to a reduction in overruns in construction projects, particularly within the government sector, thereby refining construction project management practices. This leads to enhanced infrastructure development and may result in reduced project costs for consumers. Furthermore, employing machine learning models for cost prediction can enhance transparency in construction projects. Originality/value: The application of advanced predictive methodologies, such as the CatBoost algorithm, in the construction sector offers actionable insights since industry practitioners will be able to use the developed models to improve business practices.

A two-step methodology was used. First, a literature review identified 80 pricing factors spanning macroeconomics, market, regional, client, and project categories. This was followed by a quantitative analysis employing Multivariate Regression, Random Forest, and Ensemble Learning models, applied to 14 years of bid data from the Michigan Department of Transportation. Key findings show that ensemble learning models outperformed other methods in predicting contract-level unit bid prices, achieving a higher explanatory power with an R2 of 0.63.

Feed producers who wish to produce non-genetically modified (non-GM) feed must segregate ingredients, especially corn and soybeans, throughout the supply chain. All supply chain participants must apply segregation practices to minimize the allowable presence of GM material, termed adventitious presence (AP), in non-GM product loads. All these actions and processes raise concerns about production costs. The approach of this study was to model the feed supply chain segregation costs at country grain elevators, focusing on non-GM corn and soybeans. To estimate the costs of successfully reaching four specified tolerance levels (0.9%, 1.5%, 3.0%, and 5.0%), 24 scenarios were constructed and evaluated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Input variables were drawn from previous literature findings on segregation within the grain elevator environment and the costs of segregation actions. These variables included costs for new or dedicated equipment construction, testing costs, segregation method, facility capacity, and cleaning approaches. Scenarios were categorized by segregation method and facility capacity. Findings: According to the model, the grain elevator was expected to spend an additional $0.03 to $0.04 per bushel to handle and segregate non-GM soybeans as compared with GM soybeans and an additional $0.07 to $0.08 per bushel to successfully segregate non-GM corn. Conclusion: Grain elevators are expected to spend an additional $0.03 to $0.04 per bushel to successfully handle and segregate non-GM soybeans as compared with GM soybeans. Costs to successfully handle and segregate non-GM corn were an additional $0.07 to $0.08 per bushel. Significance and Novelty: The study provides cost estimates for segregating non-GM corn and soybeans in a grain elevator. When non-GM corn and soybeans are used as part of feed ingredients, feed costs will increase. © 2024 The Author(s).

Using a dataset of over 21,000 desalination projects, refined to 10,314 after data cleaning, key variables analyzed include plant size, technology type, location, and procurement models. CAPEX values ranged from $8000 to $2.56 billion, influenced by plant scale, technology, geographic constraints, and logistical challenges. The study examines reverse osmosis (RO), multi-stage flash (MSF), and multi-effect distillation (MED), identifying RO as the most cost-effective due to its energy efficiency. Traditional cost estimation methods, such as parametric models and rule-based approaches, rely on historical averages, fixed cost coefficients, and expert judgment, often failing to capture complex, nonlinear interactions. Machine learning significantly improves estimation accuracy by identifying hidden patterns in large datasets. Evaluated models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, showed varying accuracies, with the CatBoostRegressor reducing prediction errors by over 50 %. It performed best for small and medium-sized plants, while large-scale plants exhibited greater cost variability. Key findings indicate that larger plants, specialized technologies like thermal desalination, and remote locations increase costs. Procurement models impact CAPEX, with privately funded and public-private partnership (PPP) projects proving more cost-effective than government-only models due to competitive supplier dynamics. Plants using equipment from leading membrane and energy recovery device (ERD) suppliers achieved better cost-to-efficiency ratios.

Therefore, accurately predicting costs to complete the construction projects is a vital point. Several research studies focus on cost estimation, construction risk factors, and their cost impact. Although they produced valuable prediction models for the completion cost of the projects, most of them mainly concentrated on the early stages of the construction. Limited studies produced approaches for completion cost estimation in the execution phase of the projects. Nevertheless, they do not implement total risk score effects in their models. Additional research is necessary to investigate risk-based completion cost prediction throughout the execution phase of construction. The main objective of this study is to provide an approach for the total risk score based completion cost prediction by using machine learning techniques without imposing excessive work. The proposed approach can be utilized at any point during the execution phase of a project to assess the impact of changes in total risk scores on completion costs. Furthermore, predicting the total completion cost using the total risk score simplifies the calculation and procedure rather than depending on breakdowns. To achieve this objective, a machine learning prediction approach was proposed to predict total completion cost based on total risk scores in construction projects. The proposed approach is applied to real-world cases to evaluate the accuracy of completion cost prediction based on risk scores using data from an international construction company. A total of 119 risk and cost data points from 11 projects were analyzed. Six prediction algorithms were employed, utilizing machine learning. Based on the outputs, it was determined that polynomial regression produced the most accurate predictions for available data.

These complex projects need to have accurate estimation because cost estimate helps in tendering stage, pre construction stage and during the construction stage. This study compares the costs of a unit in an STP by using BIM software versus the conventional method. For BIM approach, to create a three-dimensional model of the STP unit using 2D floor plan, Revit software is used. Schedules of quantities are then produced under the schedule option in the software to calculate the cost of construction components. The result is, the percentage difference of quantities between the conventional method and BIM approach in excavation, PCC, footing, column, beam, slab, RCC wall, plaster, exterior paint, interior paint, railing, and steel is 0.41%, 0.39%, - 0.15%, -0.03%, 0.33%, -0.05%, 0.38%, -2.37%, -2.47%, -2.10%, 0% and -3.48% respectively. The total estimated cost of STP unit by conventional method is Rs 74,13,845/- and Rs 74,97,461/- by BIM software respectively. The BIM-Assisted Detailed Estimating (BADE) tool's visualization and aggregation features in BIM significantly outperform the conventional method for the detailed estimate.

Despite advancements, many proposed solutions for information extraction and utilization remain impractical due to complexity and lack of interoperability. Information is often siloed in proprietary formats, making it difficult to integrate. This issue is evident in the construction safety domain, where advanced risk analysis tools provide detailed insights to hazards but can be overwhelming. Similar challenges exist in cost estimation, schedule evaluation, progress monitoring, and quality compliance checking. Decision-making in construction scheduling struggles to assess how changes impact site safety due to insufficient information and knowledge extraction capabilities, especially when it comes to cross-domain knowledge extraction. This study aims to make safety information accessible to safety and planning professionals. By leveraging Digital Twins, automated safety analysis, and knowledge representation, we enable decision-makers to gain deeper insights into their domain and understand the interplay between project planning and safety. We propose a framework for knowledge extraction, an ontology for capturing knowledge, and query building blocks to transform natural language questions into actionable queries. These methods are tested in a case study, revealing valuable insights into the cross-domain impact of decisions. © 2025 The Author(s)"

First, an index system containing multiple dimensions such as building features, structural features, project positioning, and project environment is constructed to comprehensively capture the key factors affecting construction cost and overspending risk. Second, the Elman neural network’s structure and operation are thoroughly examined, and the GA optimizes the network’s weights and thresholds to improve the model’s predictive power. On the training set, the optimized GA-Elman model demonstrates great prediction accuracy, with relative error (RE) percentages between predicted and true values typically falling within ±1%. On the test set, the GA-Elman model performs better than the original Elman model in both difference and RE, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 2.75%, a decrease of 18.4% compared to the Elman model. These results indicate that the GA-Elman model is more accurate in cost prediction and more effective in identifying potential overspending risks.

The partially self-centering building structures have been considered as an efficient solution for balancing the initial construction costs and reducing the residual drifts. This paper aims to present a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of partially self-centering buckling restrained frames (PSBRBFs) through life-cycle cost investigations. To this end, six building structures, including traditional buckling restrained frames (BRBF), emerging fully self-centering braced frames (FSCBFs), and PSBRBFs were first designed using the same peak displacement objective. The structural performances of the designed structures were further evaluated by dynamic analysis. Finally, comparative life-cycle cost estimations were conducted for the designed systems, where the influence of the self-centering brace's (SCB's) cost, building content's value, PSBRBF's self-centering capacity, and the limit of residual inter-story drift (RID) were comprehensively studied. Results show that PSBRBFs have the potential to achieve more benefits than FSBRBFs and BRBFs by balancing the seismic annual loss and initial construction costs. Based on the comparative analysis results, the recentering demand model of PSBRBFs was developed with the consideration of the building's lifetime, RID limit, building content's value, and SCB's cost, which can provide a design guideline for the practical application of PSBRBFs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

This concomitantly makes the sector immensely important to protect and incredibly profitable. Unfortunately, it is regarded by both public opinion and independent research as one of the most corrupt industries, particularly in the public sphere. To battle these emerging cases, there is a pressing need for anti-fraud initiatives and monitoring systems. Currently, there is a lacuna in our understanding of fraudulence detection within the construction industry. To deliver a cost-effective and precise solution, the researchers opt to employ a hybrid genetic algorithm—artificial neural network algorithm to serve as a first-pass mechanism to filter public road projects en masse in order to isolate projects that have outlying costs with regards to their scale and scope. A hybrid genetic algorithm-artificial neural network was initialized for a regression-based cost estimation model and a classification-based fraud detection model. Synthetic data generation techniques were applied to generate a well-behaved dataset of 1000 tuples each of fraudulent and non-fraudulent data, validated by histogram analysis, pairwise mutual information comparison, and a two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The cross-validation results yield an MSE of 0.057 for the cost estimation model and a 99.50% accuracy for the corruption detection model for the best network architecture. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025."

This paper describes the implementation of advanced methodologies utilizing digital tools to modernize the well construction cost management workflow, adopted by an operator in Malaysia. The application's flexible architecture facilitates a scalable workflow to meet the company's cost estimation standards, in which each front-end stage requires a different level of input granularity depending primarily on the quality of information available to assemble the estimate. This approach effectively indicates the variance in the expected well cost at every stage throughout the data maturation. The probabilistic cost estimation incorporates the assessment of operational risks and performance through offset well information extracted from the daily operation database. During the operation phase, the final well cost estimate model serves as the baseline for well cost tracking, where executed activity is benchmarked against the plan. This allows monitoring of time and cost variations, as well as the generation of a comprehensive lookahead for measuring the campaign performance. The operator's transition to the digital well cost platform in 2021 marked a departure from conventional spreadsheets and standalone applications. This cloud-based solution improves data management and facilitates collaboration among finance analysts, cost controllers, drilling and completion engineers, and managers. Cloud computing efficiency transformed hours-long Monte Carlo probabilistic computations to seconds, enabling more effective cost planning through what-if scenarios and sensitivity analyses, thus streamlining decision-making, especially when well plans or batch operation sequences change. The offset wells data analytics model provides precise predictions of performance and common risks captured in historical non-productive time (NPT) events. This transformation allowed for detailed operational time and cost tracking, closely monitoring deviations from the plan due to operational factors like performance, plan changes, or the execution of improvement plans during operation, aiding in the generation of accurate lookahead projections, identifying lessons learned and cost-saving opportunities. Through effective cost management, the company successfully generated accurate estimates of expected costs, achieving up to 95% accuracy when no major scope changes occur. The operational excellence was recognized with industry awards, highlighting achievements in the lowest cost per foot in drilling and completions in the years 2022 and 2023.

The results identify a number of cost-related factors, including inadequate project management, poor cost estimation, and design errors. Interestingly, some factors, such as currency exchange rate fluctuations and social and cultural influences, were found to have a limited impact on construction costs. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of experience and education level in shaping engineers’ perceptions of these cost factors. The study employs statistical analysis, including Pearson’s chi-squared test, to demonstrate associations between demographics, project characteristics, and cost-influencing factors. The findings suggest the need for refined project management practices, enhanced technical training, and the implementation of digital technologies such as Construction 4.0 to mitigate cost-related risks.

Due to the scarcity of information in the early stages of metro construction projects and the subjectivity of cost estimation (which relies heavily on the estimator's experience), it is always difficult to guarantee the accuracy of metro construction project cost estimation. Furthermore, the existing methodological models commonly used for cost estimation do not adequately consider the interpretability of the estimation results, making it difficult to promote their application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, an interpretable machine learning method is introduced into the study of cost estimation of metro construction projects, and a maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR)-light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpretable assisted investment decision-making framework is proposed. The results show that the negative impact of variable multicollinearity on model prediction is avoided by quantitatively identifying the key driving variables of costing through mRMR based on the historical data of metro construction projects and macroeconomic data. LightGBM is employed to predict the cost of metro construction projects with a mean absolute percentage error of 13.00%, surpassing the accuracy of the five baseline models. The SHAP method's introduction explains the influence of key driving variables on the model prediction response at both global and local levels, which improves the decision trust of the cost estimation of metro construction projects. The study takes into account the impact of key driving variables on the model's prediction response in a real-world context and balances the needs for estimation accuracy and variable interpretability in real-world scenarios. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The conventional approaches proved to be inadequate in achieving the demands of the contemporary era, leading to the failure to attain key performance indicators (KPIs) of projects and facing project delay issues on infrastructure projects in KSA. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the delay factors and prioritise the BIM applications toward project KPIs. To achieve the objective, the literature analysis on the KPIs and relative BIM capabilities was conducted. A novel feature of the robust methodology employed by the researchers was the study of the Delphi study and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The initial phases of the study, professionals offered multiple rounds of input and feedback utilizing the Delphi method. In the third round, a consensus was reached. Subsequently, an enhanced FAHP was employed to establish a correlation between KPIs of a project and BIM capabilities. This research revealed that the utilisation of BIM software for infrastructure projects can facilitate that clash detection, and cost estimation. Construction monitoring plays an important part in the successful utilisation of BIM applications and can help reduce costs, save time, and improve quality.

Traditional cost estimation methods rely on manual experience, which are often influenced by the complexity and uncertainty of engineering projects and thus lead to a large prediction bias. In recent years, machine learning techniques have gained extensive attention, which provide new solutions for cost prediction in power engineering. However, existing models often lack uncertainty estimation for the prediction results and have problems of low prediction accuracy, low training efficiency, and being prone to overfitting. This paper proposed a power engineering cost prediction method based on a hybrid model of natural gradient boosting (NGBoost) and light gradient boosting (LGBoost), aimed at improving prediction accuracy while providing uncertainty estimation for the predicted results. [Methods]In this study, the NGBoost model, which could estimate the probability distribution of predicted values, was introduced into the field of power engineering cost prediction. However, considering the low efficiency and overfitting problems of NGBoost, the histogram optimization algorithm of LGBoost was adopted and integrated into NGBoost. This resulted in the development of a hybrid model combining NGBoost and LGBoost, which not only improved prediction accuracy but also enabled the quantification of uncertainty in the prediction results. [Results]To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, this study used the BIM database of real engineering costs, spanning from 2002 to 2022, which included 2 000 pieces of power engineering data. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model outperforms others in terms of correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and mean bias error. Additionally, the prediction results for the test set reach a probability of 94.3％ at the 95％ confidence level. Compared to NGBoost, the hybrid model not only enhances prediction accuracy but also effectively avoids overfitting and demonstrates better training efficiency. [Conclusion]The hybrid NGBoost and LGBoost model presented in this paper improves prediction accuracy and is able to provide uncertainty estimation, fulfilling the diverse needs of power engineering cost prediction. Experimental validation confirms the advantages of the model in prediction accuracy, generalization capability, and training efficiency, which makes the model particularly suitable for cost estimation of complex power engineering projects. The highlight of this study is the development of a novel hybrid model that combines the high training efficiency of LGBoost and the uncertainty estimation capability of NGBoost, addressing the limitations of traditional models such as low training efficiency and overfitting and having the capability to quantify the uncertainty of prediction results. The proposed model can offer valuable support for optimizing resource allocation and improving decision-making efficiency. © 2025 Shenyang University of Technology. All rights reserved."

Accurately predicting the shear wall ratio (i.e., the shear wall area-to-floor area ratio) during cost estimation and rapidly generating shear wall layouts during early design is essential. However, the unclear influences of numerous design feature parameters hinder the enhancement of generative AI design. This affects both the prediction of shear wall ratios from multidimensional features and the generation of shear wall layouts from high-dimensional features. Therefore, a method for generating key structural design features using machine learning (ML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), along with model interpretation, is proposed in this study. Existing shear wall design data are collected, and features such as the architectural plan geometry, seismic design conditions, and shear wall ratios are extracted to establish a dataset. Key shear wall ratio parameters are predicted using an ML model with multidimensional design features as inputs, and interpretability analysis is conducted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Concurrently, a GAN model is built to generate shear wall designs using fused image-text high-dimensional features, and the influence patterns of design features are explained through sensitivity analysis. The analysis results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively enhanced by ML-based multidimensional feature learning, shear wall designs are effectively generated by GAN-based high-dimensional feature learning, and seismic design intensity and structural height are revealed as significant factors through interpretability analysis. Furthermore, when high-dimensional feature inputs are available, the generation of comprehensive features should be prioritized for shear wall structural designs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Cost-effectiveness has been demonstrated for the use of ANN. Typically, the neural network is trained using the back propagation (BP) algorithm. Even while this technique is particularly successful at training a wide variety of networks, it suffers from slow convergence and easy trapping in local minima. Regression tree models (M5P) were used to suggest the adjustment of neural networks utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) as a technique for predicting building costs due to the potential of multiscale modelling and prediction using the incorporated relevant parameters affecting the building cost. The three models were assessed using a variety of metrics, including Mean Square Error (MSE), absolute error, and Pearson’s correlation as an accuracy criterion. The MSE was also employed as a parameter to determine the ideal number of neurons for the hidden layer. The results indicate that the PSO model outperforms the other two techniques. The study also concluded that the PSO model can accurately predict the costs of construction projects when considering specified project activities and price indices. A combination of project features and an automated modelling mechanism has the potential to provide a reliable prediction result. © 2024 The authors."

Effective cost management is vital for the success of most projects. The global construction industry has witnessed projects suffering from significant cost and time overruns, with over 400 projects in India alone reportedly facing cost overruns exceeding 150 crore rupees each. Even though India is one of the largest construction industries, cost management techniques like earned value management, life cycle costing and other techniques have been implemented. Nevertheless, challenges faced in overcoming delays and cost overrun have drastically increased with the increase in complexity of the projects. Therefore, cost management is deemed an essential functional role in the present market scenario. The study uncovers the most effective tools and techniques for cost management at 4 stages: cost management planning, cost estimation, cost budgeting and cost control. It also analyzes the factors influencing these stages and thus it helps in avoiding cost overrun. A comprehensive analysis of real-time industry practices is performed based on the results obtained from a questionnaire survey. Relative Importance Index (RII) and one sample T test is used in analyzing the survey data and ranking is assigned for each factor and tools and technique.

This study utilizes Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and has identified 10 critical risk factors that significantly influence cost overruns in mining projects. These critical factors include impractical project schedules, inadequate project feasibility studies, client pressure to minimize the initial capital requirements, inaccurate cost estimations, increase of inflation rates, increase of official exchange rate, poorly understood geological and geotechnical aspects of a deposit, permit acquisition and approval delay, supply chain delays, and Impact on local communities and infrastructure. The robust analysis demonstrated strong indicator loadings and validated the measurement model’s discriminant validity. Significant findings from this analysis revealed that technical risks have the most direct influence on inadequate project planning risks, while compliance risks notably affect contracting and procurement risks. Further findings indicated that management and funding risks significantly influence both technical risks and market and economic risks.

Accurate CCI forecasting is essential to prevent cost underestimation or overestimation, ensuring the economic feasibility of construction projects. This study forecasts the CCI using a multivariate time series model, Vector Autoregression (VAR), to address the limitations of univariate models, especially during economic uncertainty. Through statistical validation, three leading indicators were identified: construction order amount, business survey index (BSI), and producer price index (PPI) for structural steel. The proposed model was optimized using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), while benchmark models ARIMA, VAR (CPI, PPI), and SVR were optimized through grid search. Model validation was conducted using data from January 2000 to April 2023, segmented into three economic phases: stability, heightened uncertainty, and a combined period. Walk-forward cross-validation assessed predictive performance over short-term forecasts of 3 months, mid-term forecasts of 6 months, and long-term forecasts of 12 months, with evaluation based on averaged performance metrics over multiple iterations. Results showed that the proposed model achieved the lowest error and highest accuracy in short-and mid-term forecasts. For long-term forecasts, SVR recorded the lowest error; however, qualitative analysis indicated that the proposed model more effectively captured overall trends in a balanced manner.

Most of our daily appliances, tools, and personal belongings are inseparable from electricity. To ensure a proper electricity distribution with an efficient transfer capability, Extra-High Voltage (EHV) transmission towers are needed. To design such a structure, it is of utmost importance to account for the cost of said tower. However, the process to estimate the cost of EHV transmission towers is both time-consuming and strenuous on human labor since a lot of consideration have to be taken. To overcome this, an imperative requirement exists for a prompt, precise, and automated tool to replace the existing manual cost estimation method. This research endeavor aims to craft a tool using support vector regression (SVR) with the capacity to prognosticate construction expenses for projects involving EHV transmission towers. The exploration of pertinent literature has enabled us to amass historical data and delineate the attributes essential for estimating costs linked to EHV transmission tower construction. The investigation delves into a comprehensive dataset spanning the past decade in Taiwan. Within this timeframe, 317 EHV transmission towers were erected between 2009 and 2019. However, 79 of these instances are excluded due to incomplete information, thereby yielding 238 viable datasets (comprising 75 % of the overall total) to underpin the development of the SVR model. By configuring the parameters to C = 0.2 and γ = 0.1, followed by 5-fold cross-validation, the resultant SVR model attains a remarkable prediction accuracy of 97.91 %, on average. As a result, the proposed SVR-based model can effectively and accurately predict the cost of constructing an EHV transmission tower project and reduce the time spent on estimation, thus contributing to the enhancement of the resilience and robustness of the transmission network system. © 2024"

Traditional nuclear power cost assessment methods, tailored for mature technologies, lack relevance for advanced systems like ADANES. To address this gap, our study proposes a unique cost analysis approach, dividing ADANES into two stages: the experimental research and development (ERD) stage and the industrial demonstration (ID) stage. Specificlly, in the ERD stage, this study employs a Logistic function-based evaluation method that considers factors such as construction period extension, the proportion of fixed costs, and the upper limit of cost estimated by experts to address potential cost overruns. For the ID stage, this study utilizes a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to account for uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to analyze the impact of parameter changes, including construction period extension and acceptable upper limits of cost and duration. Results reveal a substantial increase in expected cost during the ERD stage, ranging from 100% to 140% of the original budget when extending the experimental research duration by 10% to 50%. The ID stage demonstrates an even more significant impact, with a 50% construction period extension resulting in an expected cost of 182% of the original budget. The study suggests that judiciously extending acceptable cost and duration caps can enhance the project's success rate. This innovative cost analysis approach provides valuable insights for navigating the uncertainties associated with ADANES development. © 2023"

However, decision-makers necessitate quick and reliable capital investment estimations to evaluate innovative technologies, especially in the early project stage, when limited historical data are available. To address this need, we built a database of 160+ chemical recycling plants, querying for nominal capacity, year and place of construction, total capital investment (TCI), number of long-term jobs and opportunity of subsidies. Then, we compared conventional association of the advancement of cost engineering AACE class 5 estimation methods, with literature estimates, and commercial capital expenditure confidence intervals for pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, and selective dissolution. We demonstrate the unreliability of classic methods, and we propose ballpark correlations based on the plant capacity, or the energy loss. Chemical recycling plants suffer from poor economy of scale (with current technologies), and capacity is not always the best indicator for TCI estimation. Pyrolysis and gasification are energy-driven technologies, and their TCI correlates very well (R2=0.91–0.92) with the total energy losses. Solvolysis and selective dissolution, instead, are at an earlier development stage, so cost engineers or researchers will have to accept less certain TCI vs capacity (R2=0.60). © 2024 The Authors.

For example, determining the optimal configuration of panels (generally called panelization) that form the structure of a building is one aspect of cost estimation. However, existing methods typically rely on rule-based approaches that may lead to suboptimal material usage, particularly in complex designs featuring angled walls and openings. Such inefficiency can increase costs and environmental impact due to unnecessary material waste. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Panelization Algorithm for Architectural Designs, referred to as PAAD, which utilizes a genetic evolutionary strategy built on the 2D bin packing problem. This method is designed to balance between strict adherence to manufacturing constraints and the objective of optimizing material usage. PAAD starts with multiple potential solutions within the predefined problem space, facilitating dynamic exploration of panel configurations. It approaches structural rules as flexible constraints, making necessary corrections in post-processing, and through iterative developments, the algorithm refines panel sets to minimize material use. The methodology is validated through an analysis against an industry implementation and expert-derived solutions, highlighting PAAD’s ability to surpass existing results and reduce the need for manual corrections. Additionally, to motivate future research, a synthetic data generator, the architectural drawing encodings used, and a preliminary interface are also introduced. This not only highlights the algorithm’s practical applicability but also encourages its use in real-world scenarios. Copyright: © 2024 Fisher et al."

However, the current cost estimation of residential engineering in China is primarily carried out by cost personnel based on their own experience. This process is time-consuming and labour-intensive, and it involves subjective judgement, which can lead to significant estimation errors and fail to meet the rapidly developing market demands. Data collection for residential construction projects is challenging, with small sample sizes, numerous attributes, and complexity. This paper adopts a hybrid method combining a grey relational analysis, Lasso regression, and Backpropagation Neural Network (GAR-LASSO-BPNN). This method has significant advantages in handling high-dimensional small samples and multiple correlated variables. The grey relational analysis (GRA) is used to quantitatively identify cost-driving factors, and 14 highly correlated factors are selected as input variables. Then, regularization through Lasso regression (LASSO) is used to filter the final input variables, which are subsequently input into the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to establish the relationship between the unit cost of residential projects and 12 input variables. Compared to using LASSO and BPNN methods individually, the GAR-LASSO-BPNN hybrid prediction method performs better in terms of error evaluation metrics. The research findings can provide quantitative decision support for cost estimators in the early estimation stages of residential project investment decision-making. © 2024 by the authors."

The typically ecologically fragile area, Shangri-la, was selected as the study area in the northwestern Yunnan. GEDI waveform data was used as the information source to extract 46245 forest footprints parameters. The empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) method was used to obtain the continuous distribution of footprints parameters in the unknown space of the study area. Then, combined with 54 measured samples data, the recursive feature elimination method of support vector machine (SVM-RFE), random forest (RF) and Pearson analysis were chosen to optimize the characteristic variables, respectively. The best estimation model of forest canopy closure was studied and constructed by Bayesian optimal random forest regression model (BO-RFR), Bayesian optimal gradient regression model (BO-GBRT), and partial least square method (PLSR). The results showed that: (1) The EBK method had high prediction accuracy and reliable estimation results. Its R2 was 0.20-0.92, RMSE was 0.004-2812.912, MAE was 0.003-1996.258, and MRE was 0.007-4.423. (2) There were slight differences in the method selection of characteristic variables and number based on different characteristic optimization methods. Among the three methods, the SVM-RFE method selected six parameters (cover, pai, sensitivity, rv_al, rv_a4, rg_a4) with an average cross-validation accuracy of 0.84. The RF method selected five parameters (cover, pai, pgap_theta_error, modis_treecover, modis_nonvegetated) with a contribution of 5% as the threshold. The Pearson method significantly selected five parameters (cover, pai, rv_a5, rg_a5, pgap_theta_error) with a correlation greater than 0.3 and at the 0.01 level. (3) The modeling parameters selected by different characteristic variable optimization methods had great differences in the prediction accuracy of the estimation model. Among them, the accuracy of the estimation models constructed from the parameters selected by the SVM-RFE and RF methods was better, while the accuracy of the estimation models based on the optimization parameters of SVM-RFE method was relatively stable. The BO-GBRT model in the RF method was the best FCC estimation model (R2=0.85, RMSE=0.069, P=86.5%). (4) The BO- GBRT model was used to estimate the forest canopy closure and spatial mapping in the study area, which had high spatial correlation with the FCC predicted by the GEDI pai parameter of 0.53, and the mean values of the FCC were 0.58 and 0.61, which were mainly distributed in the range of 0.4-0.7, accounting for 65.45% and 51.79%, respectively. The forest canopy closure in the study area was mainly in moderate canopy closure, and the northern area was mainly in high canopy closure area, which was consistent with the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage in the study area. It indicated that the method of estimating forest canopy closure using GEDI data in this study was feasible and the results were very reliable. Our research laid a foundation for the efficient, timely and low-cost estimation of forest horizontal structural parameters at large spatial scales based on GEDI data. © 2024 Science Press.

It plays a different and decisive role by providing programs that contribute to this. To build this software while avoiding risks during the implementation and construction process, it is necessary to estimate the cost. The cost estimation process is the process of estimating the effort, time, and resources needed to build a software project. It is a crucial process as it provides good planning during the construction and implementation process and reduces the risks you may be exposed to. Therefore, previous studies sought to build models and methods to estimate this, but they were not accurate enough to complete the process. Therefore, this study seeks to build a model using the Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm. Five datasets the COCOMO81, COCOMONasaV1, COCOMONasaV2, Desharnais, and China were used. The dataset was processed to remove noise and missing values, visualized to understand it, and linked using a time series to predict the future values of the data. It will then be trained on the ARIMA algorithm. To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the model for use, four famous evaluation criteria were used: mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean magnitude of relative error (MdMRE), and prediction accuracy (PRED). This experiment showed impressive software cost estimation results, with MMRE, RMSE, MdMRE, and PRED results being 0.07613, 0.04999, 0.03813, and 95% for the COCOMO81 dataset, respectively. The results were high for the COCOMONasaV1 dataset, reaching 0.02227, 0.02899, 0.01113, and 97.1%. The COCOMONasaV2 results were 0.01035, 0.00650, 0.00517, and 99.35%, respectively. The China dataset showed good prediction results of 0.00001, 0.00430, 0.00008, and 99.57%, respectively. The results were impressive and promising for the Desharnais dataset, showing 0.00004, 0.0039, 0.00002, and 99.6%.

Typically, it constitutes around 20–25% of the total construction cost for a project. However, this percentage can vary depending on various factors, including the type of work, project size, construction site, material quality, construction items, and the complexity of the project. Therefore, achieving a reasonably accurate cost estimation for the facade value in construction estimates is crucial, particularly when based on the concept drawing. However, predicting these costs is challenging due to the multitude of interactions among various variables. To tackle this issue, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being explored. This paper aims to present a cost estimation of the facade system for high-rise buildings by constructing a database using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) model. Additionally, Solver in excel software is employed to determine the optimal weights in the CBR model, enhancing the accuracy of cost estimation. By leveraging ML and the excel tool, this method offers valuable insights for making informed decisions during construction planning and design. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

In this study, cost and duration of excavation by dozer is estimated by simulating the movements of the dozer. Specifications of the dozer, soil conditions and site conditions are defined to the simulator. The simulation considers tire penetration, rolling, grade, hauling, as well as cutting resistances and estimates the necessary force to be applied. The simulation implements an autonomous grading algorithm established for electric powered dozers which starts grading from a local highest point to prevent uphill excavation and hauling. The algorithm determines the necessary maneuvers to reach local highest point, excavate or haul the earth pile to the dump area. The simulation runs until the objected elevation is obtained at each portion of the excavation site. The simulator calculates the consumed energy, time, and total cost of the excavation. The excavations of 30x45 square meter area by one existing electric dozer and five updated versions of it are simulated. The simulation of the excavation is computed in 23 seconds for the smallest and 10 seconds for the largest dozer. The cost of grading and pushing the excavated material at most 20 meters away is estimated as less than 5 cents/m3 for the lead-acid battery powered dozer and 8 cents/m3 in the average for the lithium-ion battery powered dozers. The simulation revealed that electric powered dozers have less unit excavation cost than diesel powered ones, also larger dozers consumes less energy than the smaller ones. The developed simulation technique is implemented without any numerical errors and the technique can be beneficial for the construction machine manufacturers to optimize their designs and for the contractors to select the most suitable construction machine among the present alternatives.

This study analyzes construction project delay disputes, using randomly selected litigated cases of delayed construction projects from Kuwait. Data from 40 real delay dispute cases obtained from the Department of Experts at the Ministry of Justice in Kuwait were analyzed, and a multilinear regression model was developed to predict the claimed value resulting from delay disputes, which could be a crucial aspect in determining legal system fees and project cost estimations. The study compared real case dispute analysis with those previously published. The results of the study revealed that the most common source of delay disputes is those between the client and contractor, forming about 75% of the total delay disputes cases and 97% of claimed values.

Using machine learning methods to predict construction costs has become a new trend. However, machine learning methods typically require a large amount of data for model training, which makes it particularly challenging in data-poor areas. This paper proposes a novel method, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm-Guided Multi-Layer Perceptron with Transfer Learning (GOA-MLP-TL), specifically designed for construction cost estimation in data-poor areas. GOA-MLP-TL utilizes the global optimal search capability of the GOA to optimize the parameters of the MLP network. Additionally, an adaptation layer is added into the MLP network, using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure as a regularization to bridge the gap between the source and target domains. The GOA-MLP-TL can effectively leverage the model trained on data-rich area, and transfer the knowledge to adapt the model suitable for data-poor areas. The proposed approach is verified on two datasets from different areas, and the experimental result shows that, compared to the traditional machine learning method MLP and GOA-MLP without transfer learning, the correlation coefficient (R2) of the proposed GOA-MLP-TL is improved by 12.05% and 6.90%, respectively.

This study systematically reviews previous works employing AI for conceptual cost estimation, focusing on the techniques adopted and the scorers utilised. The results show a rising trend in AI adoption, including supervised machine learning, knowledge-based, and evolutionary techniques.

As an important part of the energy system, the power system plays an important role in achieving sustainable energy development. Future power systems will be sustainable, with a high proportion of renewable energy such as photovoltaic and wind power. With advancements in technology and the sustainable development of power systems, the construction costs of wind power, photovoltaics, and other renewable energy sources will continue to decline. At the same time, in order to cope with the uncertainty of renewable energy, more flexible resources need to be built. Under a high proportion of sustainable energy penetration, the utilization rate of flexible resources is low, which will lead to an increase in adjustment costs. Economic issues have an important impact on the development of new power systems, and power system construction will in turn affect social and economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze changing trends in electricity prices in the process of power system sustainability from a quantitative perspective, so as to provide guidance for future planning. In view of the above problems, this paper takes Gansu Province as an example, predicts future power installation trends, by analyzing the power system form evolution, and uses production operation simulation technology to determine the power generation and consumption situation. On this basis, the costs of various power supplies and power grids are calculated, and trends in electricity prices in Gansu Province are forecast. © 2024 by the authors."

It is expected to be highly accurate. However, industry surveys have advocated that in the Iranian construction industry, the pre-tender estimated costs of construction projects are not sufficiently accurate during the bidding stage. Building information modelling (BIM) technology is a modern digital tool deployed in the construction industry that has seen substantial growth of application. It employs useful tools in different sectors and has extended its involvement in various stages of the project lifecycle, including feasibility studies, planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance. This study examines and assesses the status of BIM development in Iran for its applicability in the pre-tender cost estimating process in construction projects. The findings of this study indicate that while there is a limited number of Iranian building projects’ BIM models that possess the required quality and capabilities for BIM-based cost estimation, the results obtained are more precise when compared to existing manual methods. Additionally, utilising BIM-based cost estimation significantly reduces the time required for this process by enhancing the speed of cost estimation operations. An innovative evaluation framework for assessing the quality and functionalities of BIM models is presented, which improves the accuracy of cost estimation before the bidding process in Iran’s construction industry. The research findings demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and effectiveness of BIM as compared to conventional approaches. It also suggests the incorporation of AI technology for model evaluation, which has the potential to become an established global industry standard. © 2024 by the authors."

The inherent complexity of construction projects necessitates the integration of BIM models endowed with automation functionalities for schedules and cost estimation. This integration ensures that updates seamlessly occur throughout the construction process, thereby mitigating project uncertainties and reducing overall costs. While the potential benefits of BIM are recognized, a substantial challenge persists in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field defining workflows for the automated generation of optimized 4D/5D BIM simulation and analysis. The effective utilization of BIM as a transformative tool requires addressing this challenge to unlock its full potential in project management. BIM serves as a pivotal conduit for project data, providing a structured approach to elevate overall product quality, streamline processes, and minimize contingencies and costs associated with construction projects. Consequently, the successful implementation of BIM with automated 4D/5D simulation and analysis stands as a critical milestone in advancing the capabilities of the AEC industry, ensuring greater efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness in construction projects.

Embracing the whole-life costing (WLC) approach, the construction sector strategically manages expenses across a construction project’s life cycle. However, despite its widespread adoption, accurate cost forecasting remains a major challenge. The intricate interplay of various influencing factors has not been fully explored, leading to inaccurate cost estimations. A comprehensive understanding of specific factors and their interrelationships is crucial to address this issue. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct further research to identify and explore the subtle nuances of these factors that impact whole-life cost estimation. Our study fills this gap, analysing 51 factors from 84 papers across prominent repositories. We assess interrelationships using a systematic literature review and pairwise comparison as in the analytical hierarchy process. The International Construction Measurement Standards (ICMS) framework structures these relationships and is represented in the causal loop diagrams (CLDs). The pioneering CLDs are a notable contribution, illustrating interrelationships and polarities among the 51 WLC factors. Six reinforcing loops and one balancing loop provide valuable insights into their dynamic nature. Importantly, lower-level factors do not always directly connect with upper-level factors. Instead, they interact within the same level before linking to top-level factors.

Owners, particularly in green building projects, often face challenges due to the scarcity of usable data, making cost estimation a complex task. They struggle to differentiate between costs associated with existing buildings and green buildings. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach that leverages conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGANs) for data augmentation, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on historical data. This involves training an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model using synthetic data, effectively addressing the scarcity and imbalance present in the original small data set. Compared to models trained exclusively on the original data set, our approach yielded a remarkable reduction of approximately 66% in root-mean-square error (RMSE), while increasing the validity from 0% to 15.09%.

LSMBM considers moments to determine the optimal hyperplane and uses the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to assign weights to each data point. The effectiveness of LSMBM was tested by predicting the construction costs of residential and reinforced concrete buildings. Correlation analysis, PCA, and LASSO were used for feature selection to identify the most relevant variables, with the combination of LSMBM-PCA giving the best performance. When compared to other machine learning models, the LSMBM model achieved the lowest error values, with an RMSE of 0.016, MAE of 0.010, and MAPE of 4.569%. The overall performance measurement reference index (RI) further confirmed the superiority of LSMBM. Furthermore, LSMBM performed better than the Earned Value Management (EVM) method.

In the process of technological implementation, design optimization is crucial for cost reduction. Through numerical simulation methods, the paper studied the heat production of the system in different climate zones in China and calculated the heat required for snow melting on bridge decks under three different levels of snow melting targets. Additionally, a cost estimation model was established to analyze the most cost-effective energy pile-based snow melting scheme for representative cities in each climate zone. Based on this model, calculation software was developed to simplify the application process. The results showed that the construction and installation costs of the bridge deck and heat pump costs had the greatest impact on the overall costs in short-term operations. However, in the long run, electricity prices became the most critical factor. With changes in heat flux demand, the total cost increase in electricity-based snow melting system was about twice that of energy pile-based system. In harsh climates and with more stringent snow melting targets, the relative saving curve of the energy pile-based snow melting system was steeper, showing significant advantages. Moreover, national policy support can offset the high initial investment cost of this system, enhancing its market competitiveness. © 2024 Editorial Office of Journal of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Engineering.

Previous research has identified various factors that impact cost estimation performance, with most under organizational controls, including input, behaviour, and output controls. Despite this, the causal relationships between these controls and cost estimation performance have not been thoroughly explored, especially from the perspective of diverse project complexities. To address this gap, this paper aimed to evaluate the effect of organizational controls on cost estimation performance, including the moderating effect of project complexity. Data were collected from 152 respondents in Malaysian construction firms, and a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method was used for data analysis. This paper reveals that all organizational controls significantly influenced cost estimation performance dimensions, except for one relationship. Additionally, only three moderating effects were found to be significant. These results highlight the importance of effective organizational controls in achieving better cost estimation performance across various levels of project complexity.

Even with the existing research undertaken on the subject, the problem of inaccurate estimation of highway bid items still exists. This paper aims to assess the accuracy of the cost estimation methods employed in the selected studies to provide insights into how well they perform empirically. Additionally, this research seeks to identify, synthesize and assess the impact of the factors affecting highway unit prices because they affect the total cost of highway construction costs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper systematically searched, selected and reviewed 105 papers from Scopus, Google Scholar, American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Transportation Research Board (TRB) and Science Direct (SD) on conceptual cost estimation of highway bid items. This study used content and nonparametric statistical analyses to determine research trends, identify, categorize the factors influencing highway unit prices and assess the combined performance of conceptual cost prediction models. Findings: Findings from the trend analysis showed that between 1983 and 2019 North America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East contributed the most to improving highway cost estimation research. Aggregating the quantitative results and weighting the findings using each study's sample size revealed that the average error between the actual and the estimated project costs of Monte-Carlo simulation models (5.49%) performed better compared to the Bayesian model (5.95%), support vector machines (6.03%), case-based reasoning (11.69%), artificial neural networks (12.62%) and regression models (13.96%). This paper identified 41 factors and was grouped into three categories, namely: (1) factors relating to project characteristics; (2) organizational factors and (3) estimate factors based on the common classification used in the selected papers. The mean ranking analysis showed that most of the selected papers used project-specific factors more when estimating highway construction bid items than the other factors. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by analyzing and comparing the performance of highway cost estimation models, identifying and categorizing a comprehensive list of cost drivers to stimulate future studies in improving highway construction cost estimates. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The impact rate of indicators with cluster numbers from 1 to 3 decreases sequentially, and the difference between the three is less than 5%. The method proposed in the simulation experiment mostly overlaps the predicted values of two sample data with the true values, with an average difference of less than 2%.

Existing 5D BIM tools are used to estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of standardization in the use of model elements through the project lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined. According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of a cost estimation project.

Identifying the parameters that influence project cost contributes to achieving accurate results and improves the overall accuracy of cost estimation. This study applied three machine learning methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), and linear regression (LR) models, to predict the total cost of construction. The NGBoost model was employed for construction cost estimation and was compared with two machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network and linear regression. Evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of efficiency (CE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), index of agreement (d), and coefficient of determination (R2), are employed to assess and compare the accuracy of the developed algorithms. Statistical indicators revealed that the NGBoost algorithm outperformed others, displaying the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.992 for training and R2 = 0.985 for testing) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 0.5136 for training and RMSE = 0.3702). Moreover, sensitivity analysis revealed that the input parameter with the highest contribution was formwork, accounting for nearly 41%. On the other hand, the superimposed load had the lowest contribution, totaling 5%. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) method was employed to elucidate the importance and contribution of input variables influencing construction costs.

At its core is a climate-responsive machine learning model specifically developed using readily accessible early-stage design data. This model forecasts the thermal demand both in the present and in the face of likely climatic shifts. To strike a balance in energy performance goals, material cost estimation is seamlessly incorporated. Building on the gradient boosting machine, the proposed approach showed better performance than other algorithms, predicting thermal demand 25 to 37.5 times faster than conventional energy software without compromising accuracy. The key findings of the presented case studies highlight the significant influence of the Window-to-Wall ratio and floor thermal mass on thermal demand—especially in mitigating cooling demands posed by potential climate change scenarios. By enhancing interior floor types, heating demand can be reduced by nearly 49%.

In addition, it is essential to implement cutting-edge, quick, precise, and adaptable technology for productivity estimation. This study's major goal is to calculate the overall costs of sustainable buildings using the cutting-edge technique known as artificial neural networks (ANNs).

To date, there are no standardized procedures for verifying cost estimation accuracy. The association between cost data and geometric model objects is currently done manually, leading to time losses and inaccuracies in cost estimates. This study defines a new architecture for cost items within the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model to ensure structured cost data, which is currently expressed in unstructured natural language. It encompasses the definition of a cost domain in IFC, potential relationships it may have with an IFC geometric information model, and the validation of these relationships through semi-automated verification procedures of structured data (geometric-cost). A specific case study, focused on a structural IFC model, is examined to assess current and future applications. Additionally, rules for BIM information requirements will be defined through the Information Delivery Specification (IDS) to ensure clear understanding for both humans and computers. This will specify which data must be included in the geometric model to ensure validation and verification of the uniqueness of associated cost data. The results demonstrate the feasibility of defining structured cost elements in IFC and verifying their association with geometric data to ensure coherence and uniqueness in cost estimation. © 2024 The author(s)."

Construction cost projections greatly support managers' decision-making processes, and risk assessment models reduce time delay. The cost of construction projects may be modeled and forecasted using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches that require a huge amount of data. Hence, this paper proposes an AI-driven construction cost estimation and control analysis (AI-CCECA) model for analyzing the preliminary cost of building projects and dynamic management of the control system. The first step is to identify the most significant cost components and variables that affect overall building costs based on real-world data gathered from project bids and deep neural networks. As a result of this research, construction firms will benefit from improved operational efficiency and competitiveness from its ML and optimization framework. Machine learning could improve the cost estimation in the program phase of the construction process.

Despite significant strides in waste management optimisation, traditional systems have largely overlooked the management of occasional or seasonal waste such as green waste, wild dump, and construction debris. The authors seek to address this gap by deploying an IoT-enabled system to optimise resource utilisation and efficiency. Building on existing infrastructures for real-time tracking of waste collection circuits, equipment, and bin filling levels, the system incorporates an additional module to manage unpredictable waste categories. The system collects field data leveraging existing resources with minimal investment. To manage the sporadic nature of these waste types, the system employs a flexible approach with the use of sensors and algorithms for dynamic route planning and waste collection. Using the city of Tangier, Morocco, as a case study, a comprehensive methodology for waste location capture, GIS mapping, priority-based route identification, scenario testing, and operational cost estimation is implemented. A modified version of the Contraction Hierarchies algorithm is applied to compute optimal waste collection paths, ensuring timely and efficient waste removal while minimising environmental impact.

Installed to protect buildings from fire, or to limit the damage from such outbreaks, fire protection measures are a common feature in buildings. However, these features come at a cost. Although quite ubiquitous in buildings, the value of these features to private individuals and to society is not fully understood. To understand their value, a cost benefit analysis detailing the costs and benefits of fire protection measures is needed. Carrying out such an analysis requires methods for computing both the cost of these fire protection measures, and losses from fires (including both direct and indirect losses). This study outlines methodologies for evaluating those costs and losses. An exhaustive collection of available data necessary for estimating both costs and losses is presented. Several limitations in current methodologies and data constraints were identified, with recommendations proposed to address these shortcomings. Relevant sections of a study by the authors that refines fire protection cost estimation at national and sub-national levels are emphasized, including updated building categories, guidance on computing multipliers, and detailed cost calculation methods for installation and maintenance costs.

Off-site construction requires decomposing a floor plan into modules that can be in the form of either panelized walls or volumetric modules. However, the previous modularization models and approaches are limited due to their inability to consider the topological constraints of the modules, the flexible modularization of varying floor plans, and the mixed use of panelized walls and volumetric modules. As such, this paper proposes a graph-based optimization methodology for the hybrid modularization of building floor plans. The methodology was implemented using a multiobjective genetic algorithm that encodes and decodes the floor plan using novel graph modeling and operations. A visual programming script was developed to extract the wall properties, their adjacencies, and junction information from the building information model (BIM) of the floor plan. Time and cost estimation functions were developed to evaluate the hybrid strategies of panelized-volumetric modularization. The deployment of the methodology was demonstrated using an example floor plan design, which resulted in a spectrum of hybrid modularization plans ranging between fully volumetric and fully panelized solutions. For this specific example, the fully volumetric solution was 23% faster than the fully panelized solution but was 22% more expensive. The main contributions of this study are the topological modeling of module types, their floor plan postdesign flexible utilization, and the ability to explore hybrid modularization strategies. The findings of this study can prove useful for modular and off-site building manufacturers to improve their agility and increase their market share.  © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers."

To enhance efficiency, there is a pressing need for a simple, swift, accurate cost estimation model. Therefore, this study aimed to establish cost estimation model at the initial planning phase of construction work and to assess its accuracy in estimating cost for road improvement using cost significant model (CSM) compared to actual expenses. The fundamental objective was to facilitate the execution of construction work, ensuring the successful completion. Data collection occurred at the (PUPR) in Aceh Jaya Regency, consisting of 25 contracts for road improvement work spanning from 2018 to 2022. The data included the execution year, road area, total variable cost (y), and the categorization of work item as independent variables (xn). Subsequently, the work data was transformed into data per square meter (m2) for each work item by dividing each independent variable by the area of road improvement work. This showed the cost/m2 for each work item (xn) and the total cost (y)/m2. Annual inflation data was obtained from (BPS) of Aceh province used for calculation projection year. The identification of cost-significant item variables occurred after organizing the data according to work item, adjusting the work cost for the execution year and the work-year cost while considering inflation factor. Additionally, it was observed that 3 most expensive work items represented 80% work item had a substantial impact on the total cost. Classic assumption tests were conducted to confirm the suitability of data for further analysis. The analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression, resulting in a model with y = 69850.515 + 0.879(x4) + 1.085(x5) + 1.221(x7). When cost significant model estimates were compared to the actual total cost of road improvement in Aceh Jaya, the accuracy ranged from +17.46% to -19.30%, which was consistent with Class 3 classification of (AACE) International standards.This classification was suitable for semi-detailed cost estimation in the conceptual phase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, risks in construction projects make exact budgetary requirements challenging to forecast accurately, resulting in underestimation and overestimation. Inaccurate cost estimates could further result in unnecessary financial loss to project stakeholders and the loss of reputation and trustworthiness of construction professionals. In Uganda, risk factors are either ignored or subjectively taken care of by simply allowing a contingency figure ranging from 0% to 10% of the project cost. However, this method is sometimes unreliable and difficult to justify to project owners. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and justifiable risk-based cost estimation method. The current study aimed to improve risk management in cost estimation in the building construction industry in Uganda. The specific objectives were to establish the risk factors, assess the effects of the risk factors and develop a reliable model that can be used for risk-based cost estimation in the building construction industry in Uganda. The study adopted a mixed-method approach by utilising quantitative and qualitative research methods. The collection of data was done using a self-administered questionnaire and an interview guide. The data was first sorted, coded and entered for analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel. The risk factors in cost estimation were identified through a detailed literature review. The study revealed that the top five risk factors influencing cost estimation were: cost of materials, inflation, fraudulent practices and kickbacks, incomplete scope definition, and incomplete design and specification. The study concluded that the risk factors with the most severe effects on cost estimation were inflation, proficiency in estimating, cost of materials, incomplete design and specification, fraudulent practices and kickbacks. The study proposed a model developed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The study recommends more research on the efficiency and effectiveness of risk-based cost estimation models. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2024.

An architectural floor plan provides the layout of a building floor and includes objects such as walls, doors, windows, and stairs. Detection of the walls in a floor plan image is important as the walls typically define the main layout of the floor and individual rooms. In existing literature, the walls are typically detected as a single class object. However, in construction type floor plans, the walls are represented by different drawings (e.g., solid-wall, dot-wall, diagonal-wall, hollow-wall, and gray-wall) based on the raw materials used for construction. Detection of multiclass walls would be desirable for applications such as materials cost estimation by builders and building information modeling. A convolutional neural network, namely WallNetv2, is proposed for semantic segmentation of multiclass walls in a floor plan image. WallNetv2 consists of an encoder, a channel contextual module, a spatial contextual module, and a decoder. The encoder extracts the hierarchical features from the input floor plan image. The channel and spatial contextual modules capture the relationship of the high-level features among channels and pixels, respectively. The decoder further processes the learned features and recovers the spatial information gradually with connections to the low-level features. The experimental results show that the proposed WallNetv2 achieves a mean IoU of 70%, which is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2024 SPIE and IS&T."

The goal of this study is to examine and design a valid cost prediction model for assessing factors that impact the cost estimation of public buildings in Addis Ababa. This research solves these issues that typically arise in predictive cost estimation models in two major processes. First, the insights of 133 professionals gathered on the 38 cost-impacting elements, and 15 top factors design, time or cost, and parties’ experience were determined. The suggested hybrid approach is based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and principal component regression (PCR) employed, coupling a stepwise linear regression model. According to the findings of the study, principal component analysis reduced important factors to 14 and efficiently solved the problem of multicollinearity with a variance inflation factor of less than 2, while stepwise cross-validation solved the overfitting problem at the lowest AIC. The cost prediction model sorted out five factors: design completion by the public body when bids are invited; completion of the project scope definition when bids are invited; level of construction complexity; importance of project completion within budget; and subcontractor experience and capability have all been identified as the main cost-determining factors. The study’s contribution is the first approach (PCR–AIC) utilized in this work to explore numerous cost-estimating components, eliminate those that were related to one another, and identify the most crucial ones that consisted of the majority of the original variables’ attributes.

The selection of an appropriate grade of geofoam in such cases is dictated by their elastic modulus and compressive strength. However, a comprehensive parametric study on the influencing factors of compression behaviour, which is extremely critical for the design of geofoam, is rarely reported. In the present study, the effect of nominal density, apparent density, strain rate, geometry, and ambient temperature on the elastic modulus, permissible compressive stress, yield stress and compressive strength of geofoam is investigated by conducting a series of uniaxial compression tests. The variation of compressive responses due to each influencing factor is evaluated using scatter matrices and statistical bar plots. Furthermore, results reported in the literature were collated, to develop machine learning based generalised prediction models using Artificial Neural Network and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms. The XGBoost models demonstrated superior performance compared to the ANN models, achieving accuracies surpassing 87%. The correlation heat map of the results indicates that the apparent density, size, and ambient temperature control the compressive response of geofoam, while model-dependent feature analysis quantified the relative importance of these parameters. For conservative design and quality assurance, testing a 50 mm geofoam cube at a strain rate of 1% per minute, at the maximum ambient temperature of the construction site is recommended.

Leveraging historical data from completed projects is an effective strategy to achieve this. In heavy industrial projects, where scaffolding activities can span from thousands to millions of hours, refining the estimation of scaffolding time is vital during the planning phase. This study undertook the analysis of data from a completed heavy industrial scaffolding project, aiming to propose a methodology and models for predicting future projects durations. The proposed methodology not only aids in improved duration but also contributes to cost estimation, scheduling, and project delivery of similar future endeavors. Commencing with data cleaning and categorizing the data based on activity types, the scatter plots of person-hours versus task weight within each category revealed a linear relationship. Consequently, linear models for each category were developed. Statistical factors such as data size, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute error were then utilized to calculate a score for each model, guiding the model selection process which substituted low score models with a parent category with a higher score. The data analysis and modeling were performed five times to ensure robustness and consistency in the results. On average, the initial models yielded a project duration estimate of only 0.36% higher than the actual duration, while the selected models increased this deviation to 4.14%. The scoring and selection process enhances estimation accuracy while maintaining proximity to actual project durations. This research makes three significant contributions: (1) introducing a categorical linear regression approach for scaffolding activity duration prediction, (2) presenting a novel normalization and scoring method that scores models based on statistical factors, and (3) implementing a practical model selection process to substitute weaker models with stronger ones, ultimately strengthening the reliability of activity and project duration predictions. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Design/methodology/approach: The construction cost data of 30 concrete bridge projects which are in Sri Lanka constructed within the past ten years were trained and tested to develop an ANN cost model. Backpropagation technique was used to identify the number of hidden layers, iteration and momentum for optimum neural network architectures. Findings: An ANN cost model was developed, furnishing the best result since it succeeded with around 90% validation accuracy.

The study building is a residential building with G + 3 (ground + three floors) drafted in the Revit Architecture Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. A detailed estimation of the building was performed to find the building material cost, volume, and total cost. Besides, the different types of materials are proposed for each component. The units presented in this paper are in meters with uniform across the document and the decimal numbers are applied for accuracy. The building model is applied with four different building-type materials, such as concrete for slabs and columns. Where walls with brick type that is commonly used timber and glass for windows are selected, the report shall concentrate on the cost and energy analysis of the different materials that promote BIM levels 1, 2, and 3. The model is developed with auto desk–Revit and insight software for material estimation and energy analysis. Finally, the results are compared with manual estimation to show that the use of BIM modelling can be treated as a sustainable approach that promotes life cycle analysis that allows the project stakeholders to make better decisions before the erection of the structure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

A significant challenge in LCC modeling lies in the limited availability of reliable life-cycle data, leading to uncertainties in system specifications, estimation methods, and scenario analysis. Despite the existence of historical construction data, inherent uncertainties often restrict their direct use. In projects like catenary system construction for railways, LCC is heavily influenced by project length, with material costs being one of the most deterministic elements compared to other cost factors. This paper proposes a novel cost element coefficients method to facilitate the estimation of total construction costs.

This process is iterative, where estimates are regularly updated based on the available information. Studying the relationship between the costs of construction projects is crucial for establishing reliable practices of cost estimation and management. Variability in construction costs can significantly impact investors’ or clients’ decisions. Greater coherence and confirmed relationships between construction costs and factors influencing them can assist investors, developers, and contractors in making informed decisions and ensuring effective cost management. Therefore, the aim of this article is to identify the factors shaping the costs of facade systems of public utility buildings and to examine the mutual influences and dependencies that occur between these factors. The factors were selected based on an analysis of project documentation, and then their assessment was made through expert opinions. The DEMATEL method was used to investigate the mutual relationships and dependencies between the factors as one of the tools of multi-criteria analysis. Through the analysis, it can be pointed out that factors such as the height of the building, the type of facade analyzed, and the level of complexity of the facade have the greatest impact on the cost of facade systems. Moreover, the type of facade analyzed and the number of floors are the factors showing the greatest direct influence on the other factors of the cost of facade systems. The identification and prioritization of factors carried out by the authors provide a basis for future research, which are models that support the prediction of the cost of making facade systems. © 2024 by the authors."

The framework separates elemental and construction operations cost estimation for improved accuracy and integrates cost estimates with project schedules via Object-to-Schedule Maps to facilitate comprehensive cost views within the BIM workflow. It relies on a single Model View Definition (MVD) within IFC for data exchange between cost-estimating software and other BIM tools.

The construction planning of a green campus canteen includes four main activities: preparatory activities, structural work, architectural work, and mechanical work. So far, development projects executed by third parties often have delays from the schedule, therefore the construction needs to be carefully planned so the construction development can be executed efficiently, effectively, and finished on time. The delay of the project itself is a situation that should be avoided by all parties as much as possible. Therefore, this study will provide a planning concept and evaluation method for the development of a green canteen project using the Critical Part Method (CPM) and PERT (Project Evaluation and Review Technique) methods. CPM and PERT methods are used to get a realistic fastest time to finish a project. This research method is performed by processing the information derived from the project's schedule and seeking information from related workers and then processing the information using standard CPM and PERT methods.

Its primary task is to identify design errors and clashes between design disciplines during the design phase before the start of the project. Problems with such errors and clashes require frequent corrections and revisions of drawings, leading to time delays and cost overruns. For this research, a typical school project consisting of ten two-story buildings was selected as a case study, i.e., only two buildings were implemented. This paper aims to clarify and identify the cost-saving benefits that can be achieved through clash detection that supports the BIM system at the design stage. The research methodology involved gathering building data and independently converting architectural and construction drawings from 2D to 3D, subsequently exporting them to Navisworks for analysis. The findings revealed the presence of multiple design flaws that require rectification before commencing the implementation phase. According to the obtained results, it was observed that the total costs spent on each building exceeded the estimated total costs by approximately 25% due to design errors. Additionally, when considering a group of items in the bill of quantity for each building during the calculation and clash detection analysis, it was found that each item experienced a 10% increase in costs compared to the estimated values. Consequently, the combined total costs for both buildings surpassed 100 million IQD. Utilizing BIM technology has significantly influenced and improved various stages of the construction process and how BIM technology is used to create a model building that closely matches the estimated cost. © 2024, THIS IS AN OPEN ACCESS ARTICLE UNDER THE CC BY LICENSE http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"

In this article, a construction cost prediction method based on an improved bidirectional long- and short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is proposed to address the high interactivity among construction cost data and difficulty in feature extraction. Firstly, the correlation between cost-influencing factors and the unilateral cost is calculated via grey correlation analysis to select the characteristic index. Secondly, a BiLSTM network is used to capture the temporal interactions in the cost data at a deep level, and the hybrid attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance the model’s feature extraction capability to comprehensively capture the interactions among the features in the cost data. Finally, a hyperparameter optimisation method based on the improved particle swarm optimisation algorithm is proposed using the prediction accuracy as the fitness function of the algorithm.

Estimating the loss from an earthquake can be complex as unique factors, in addition to conventional repair work, that need to be considered during the postperiod stage. Previous research has been able to identify 11 factors that impact the postearthquake cost estimation for the earthquake damage repair work (CEEDRW) process. Current loss estimation methods such as PACT, SLAT, and SP3 do not incorporate the impact of all these factors. This paper identifies the factors that impact different stages of traditional CEEDRW: precontract estimates, estimates during repair work, and cost calculations after construction. Discussion around methods to adopt these modeling factors into CEEDRW is also presented. A two-stage data collection method was adopted for this paper. Data were collected through semistructured interviews using 19 participants and a questionnaire survey using 92 participants who have experience in the CEEDRW process. The interview data analysis emphasized the usage of 11 factors at the three stages of estimation. Furthermore, survey results identified the most suitable methods of incorporating each factor in CEEDRW. Existing estimation tools used for CEEDRW do not consider a number of factors. This paper suggests the most suitable methods of considering these into an estimation tool that aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the CEEDRW process. The methods identified in this paper can be used in developing more reliable future cost estimation models used to determine postearthquake damage repair work.

The foremost problem for projects in the building construction industry is producing an accurate and reliable cost estimate at the onset of construction. The artificial neural network (AΝΝ) approach, using data available at the early stages of the project, can help resolve or prevent any kind of difficulty that could make the successful completion of a building less likely. ANNs have been highly efficient in gaining results which could prevent the failure of building constructions projects. The ultimate goal is to highlight the usefulness of the adoption of ANNs models to predict the final cost of a building renovation project. Thus, construction companies could avoid financial failure, provided that the gap between cost prediction and final cost for renovation projects is minimized. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) approach for predicting renovation costs in Greek construction projects.

Currently, traditional bottom-up cost estimation used for modular residential construction projects is a time-consuming and knowledge-intensive procedure. In contrast to bottom-up cost estimation, using machine learning techniques for initial construction cost estimation can significantly overcome these drawbacks and help decision-makers effectively perform proactive cost management. Machine learning has been successfully used in studies before for this purpose, but not for projects involving the construction of modular homes. This study therefore employs and validates the use of machine learning to estimate direct costs (direct material costs and direct labour costs) in order to quickly, accurately, and conveniently estimate costs for modular residential construction projects. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2024."

However, the ambiguous nature of unit economics has deterred its more extensive integration. As such, this study first presents a deterministic model for estimating direct and indirect costs in AM and then advances a stochastic unit cost model by integrating uncertainty ranges. Using (Monte Carlo) Simulation Decomposition, this model is analyzed regarding probabilistic scenarios, the sensitivity of input factors, and uncertainty effects. The results confirm the existence of economies of scale and highlight AM’s potential for construction across a diverse range of scenarios. Managers, researchers, investors, and policymakers alike can use this model to interactively navigate the complexities of AM in the construction industry to inform decisions and drive technology development. As AM technology advances, the models can be iteratively refined and expanded, eventually improving unit economics, productivity, and profitability.

It is also very difficult to predict the change in construction costs whenever the design changes. However, using the BIM model’s attribute information and machine learning techniques, accurate construction costs can be predicted faster than when using the existing approximate cost estimate. In this study, building information such as ‘total area’, ‘floor water’, ‘usage’, and BIM attribute information such as ‘wall area’, ‘wall water’, and ‘floor circumference’ were used together to predict construction costs in the schema design stage. As a result of applying the machine learning technique using both the building design information and the BIM model attribute information, it was found that the construction cost was improved compared to the result of individual predictions of the building information or BIM attribute information.

The unclear scope definition and scarcity of project information available at early stages make it hard to generate reliable preliminary estimates. Hence, based on the 1,249 projects retrieved from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) database, this research aimed to develop a cost estimation model using statistical learning methods for SHAs to forecast preliminary costs during the early stages of a transportation project to fulfill different cost control and managerial functions. However, the currently used methods have serious limitations. This study introduced alternative statistical learning approaches to the currently most used methods: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and general regression neural network (GRNN). LASSO regression, for instance, has proved in other areas of science to be remarkably better in terms of variable selection, interpretability, and numerical stability. In addition, this study also accounted for economic factors in model development because economic conditions are influential on highway construction costs but have received limited attention. Using the same dataset, LASSO and GRNN models were developed, and then their performances were evaluated based on a set of criteria, e.g., the mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. In comparison to the current practice with state DOTs, this research contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a series of objective modeling approaches that can prevent human errors, requiring no substantial experience in preliminary estimating. Besides the introduction of statistical learning methods, this study took economic indicators into account when developing the models because they are important factors but have been ignored in previous studies. In addition, these statistical learning methods can produce reliable estimates in a much faster and more consistent fashion, which is critical, particularly considering the massive workload faced by most SHAs and the allowable time to make a preliminary estimate.  © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Several models have been developed to estimate the construction costs of new highway projects; however, few have targeted the cost of pavement rehabilitation, and, of these, most have focused primarily on the construction phase. This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) estimation model that predicts the cost of the preconstruction phases (predesign, design, and bidding) of pavement rehabilitation projects. The model was developed using 139 projects maintained by Caltrans over the past five years. Pareto principle and sensitivity analysis were used to identify five project items that contributed significantly to the model’s high estimation performance, which was demonstrated by a coefficient of multiple determination value (R 2) of 76.9%. Thus, the proposed model will allow Caltrans to properly estimate its budget and manage its performance during the preconstruction phases of pavement rehabilitation projects. Moreover, it overcomes many limitations of conventional preconstruction cost estimation models and will allow Caltrans to better manage up to $80B that may be spent on its preconstruction activities. Finally, the model provides a benchmarking tool for tracking and controlling expenses. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

One of the key points is reducing embodied carbon in materials and accounting for emissions and costs during transportation, installation, and the operation of built assets. This study presents a novel approach of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to rapidly evaluate both Whole Life-Cyle Carbon (WLC) and costs, enabling an enhanced and rapid decision-making during the early design stages. By leveraging data from Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) database and carbon databases from past projects of a top construction firm in UK, AI is found to provide real-time guidance for optimising material choices and configurations, hence balancing sustainability with budget considerations. The proposed integration of using AI techniques such as neural networks into existing carbon and cost estimation tools, such as CarboniCa Software, aims to streamline the current data entry process and provide a rapid data analysis. This not only saves time but also reduces cost of implementation and enhances productivity. This paper outlines the use of AI techniques to predict embodied carbon and cost of construction projects from key characteristic features of buildings. The results show that AI can be used to predict the expected outputs with high accuracy, consequently providing productivity improvements and reducing time and cost of implementation. The suggested approach highlights the future role of AI in driving more sustainable, productive and cost-effective construction practices. © 2024 IEEE."

As a problem, the cost estimates in real-time from walk-through interactions selecting multi-alternative building components are a potential threat to projects' success unless there is a visualization system helping to decide the costs of different building items and the items’ suitability. This research is a powerful tool that allows the project's owner to reduce the variation order by visually selecting his favorite material in the design stage. It expresses the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with Virtual Reality (VR) to improve Cost Estimation (CE) and the material selection process. The authors utilize BIM and virtual reality technology to enhance the visualization and processing of project cost estimation in the construction industry. In this study, the primary goal is to develop a BIM-VR-CE system that helps construction stakeholders to visualize and quickly to decide the costs of different building items and the items’ suitability. Accordingly, the authors developed a BIM-VR-CE system that integrates BIM and virtual reality technology using Unity 3D. Navigating building environments in real-time with the ability to select the cost and items suitable for elements of projects is now available to construction stakeholders through the BIM-VR prototype developed in this paper. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed preliminary model, a questionnaire was created, and 85 evaluations were collected.

This paper provides a support decision tool for the identification of the standardized interventions in the building envelope, the air conditioning system, and domestic hot water production. This study is focused on a specific construction period class (1976–1990) in six different climatic zones. The methodological approach is based on a cataloguing phase and the definition of ante operam energy classes as well as on case study identification, energy requalification intervention identification, solution simulations, and cost estimation. By simulating the standardized interventions for each climatic zone, a range of possible combinations is identified.

To accomplish the task initially the applicability of example swarm optimization procedure is introduced. The basic principle of particle swarm optimization procedure is described, and PSO (particle swarm optimization) procedure is used to optimize the super factors of LS- SVM. The spss20.0 statistics is used to cluster the sample data to obtain similar engineering classes. BP-NN (Back Propagation Neural Network), LS - SVM, and PSO-LSSVM are implemented to anticipate and simulate the development price for the authentication of request effect of the optimized design in that area. The results show that the relative errors of the three designs are controlled within + 10%, this may be used in the early stages of building to anticipate construction costs accurately. The range of the relative error dissemination interval predicted using the BP-NN design is 13.12% and is between [- 7.46%, 5.74%]. The range of the relative error dissemination interval predicted by the LS SVM design is 14.22% and is between [-8.12%, 6.17%]. According to the PSO-LSSVM design, the relative error dissemination interval is [-2.56%, 2.49%], and its range is 5.21%. In terms of prediction stability and robustness, the prediction design optimized using PSO procedure outperforms the LS SVM design. In conclusion, the predictions design on the basis of PSO optimized LS SVM is better appropriate for predicting construction costs early in the building process and has strong guiding importance for the cost of construction. © 2023 Slovene Society Informatika.

Such estimations are challenging due to the need for a longer time, the influence of inflation, and fluctuating project prices in developing countries. This study used three techniques—a modified Artificial Neural Network (ANN), time series, and linear regression—to predict and forecast the local building material CCI in Pakistan. The predicted CCI is based on materials, including bricks, steel, cement, sand, and gravel. In addition, the swish activation function was introduced to increase the accuracy of the associated algorithms. The results suggest that the ANN model has superior prediction results, with the lowest Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Theil’s U statistic (U-Stat) values of 0.04, 28.3, and 0.62, respectively. The time series and regression models have ME values of 0.22 and 0.3, MAE values of 30.07 and 28.3, and U-Stat values of 0.65 and 0.64, respectively.

No matter how detailed the pre-planning phase of any construction project is, there should be stumbling in one way or another during the construction phase, for example, cost overruns, delivery and handover timing amendments, difficulties in providing resources, and qualitative deficiencies. Failure in construction projects is of high risk due to the large amount of finances invested and the involvement of different partners. The risk is mainly due to delays in delivery and cost overruns, which are considered the most common and damaging factors. In this research, seven risk factors are chosen to investigate their effects on project cost overrun. They are related to (1) the project, (2) the client or owner, (3) the design, (4) the contractor, (5) the materials and equipment, (6) the manpower, and (7) external factors. This chapter studies the identified risk factors that affect the accuracy of cost estimation. It also discusses best practices in calculating cost estimates. A mixed methodology is conducted; the empirical part in the form of a survey questionnaire examines the identified factors among those who are experts in different fields of specialties. An ordered logit probability model is estimated based on the seven main risk factors. To support the empirical findings, a qualitative study is performed in the form of interviews with five experts in the construction industry. The findings report that the highest risk causing cost overruns is contractor-related factors, followed by design-related factors. On the other hand, project-related factors, materials-related factors, and external factors tend to have the lowest risk of cost overrun. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

However, the industry is loaded with numerous hazards, just like other economic sectors, making it difficult to meet project objectives. A construction project has many phases, all of which involve various risks. The first step in risk management is risk identification. The goal of this research is therefore to investigate key risk factors affecting bridge construction sector based on their probability of occurrences by using Relative Importance Index (RII). This research focuses on bridge projects across Kerala. The data are collected through a survey approach by administering a questionnaire. Professionals involved in the construction of bridges identify the project risks. Software like SPSS Statistics (Statistical Package for Social Science) are adopted to evaluate the collected responses from different personnel from the construction industry. The risks were ranked and grouped into categories as financial, legal and procurement risks. The aim of this study is to find the critical factors affecting bridge projects. This research presents the factors with the highest probability and impact on any project and to check correlation between them through statistics. As a result of the study, recommendations can be suggested to improve the accuracy of their risk response technique and associated cost estimations by taking defined risk elements into account while evaluating alternative risk management approaches. © 2023, Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

Strong cash flow positively impacts not only project effectiveness but also company profitability. Cash flow calculation is a good way for the contractors to avoid risks related to delay, cost overrun, or incompletion caused by financial deficits in the project’s performance. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a revolutionary technology 4.0 that has been mandated by many countries. In Vietnam, a roadmap for BIM application in the construction sector was issued in 2023. This mentions that from 2023, the application of BIM is compulsory for works in large-scale projects, specifically class I and higher public investment projects; from 2025, the application of BIM is compulsory for works in class II and higher in public investment projects, projects funded by non-public investment state capital, and PPP projects. In addition, for new investment projects funded by other capital sources, main investors are required to provide BIM files to serve for the appraisal of feasibility study reports, for construction permits, and for acceptance testing tasks. However, the Vietnamese contractors are still facing the inaccuracy of results when applying BIM technology to cash flow calculations. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for calculating cash flow in large-scale projects by integrating BIM authoring programming, a cost estimation system, a project scheduling system, and a spreadsheet system. The expected outcome of this research is to enhance reliability in computing the project cash flow through an easier and more accurate BIM approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

For PHEs, enhanced methods of heat transfer intensification can be further applied using the analysis and knowledge already available in the literature. A review of the main developments in the construction and exploration of PHEs and in the methods of heat transfer intensification is presented in this paper with an analysis of the main construction modifications, such as plate-and-frame, brazed and welded PHEs. The differences between these construction modifications and their influences on the thermal and hydraulic performance of PHEs are discussed. Most modern PHEs have plates with inclined corrugations on their surface that create a strong, rigid construction with multiple contact points between the plates. The methods of PHE exploration are mostly experimental studies and/or CFD modelling. The main corrugation parameters influencing PHE performance are the corrugation inclination angle in relation to the main flow direction and the corrugation aspect ratio. Optimisation of these parameters is one way to enhance PHE performance. Other methods of heat transfer enhancement, including improving the form of the plate corrugations, use of nanofluids and active methods, are considered. Future research directions are proposed, such as improving fundamental understanding, developing new corrugation shapes and optimisation methods and area and cost estimations. © 2023 by the authors."

It compares individual cost prediction models (Decision Tree, BP Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine) with combined prediction models (BP-DT and BP-SVM) for high-rise building cost prediction. The study employs interpretative analysis methods such as the Shapley additive explanation method, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots to explore feature interplay and improve model transparency. Results show that the BP-SVM combination algorithm significantly reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to other models. Key factors influencing cost estimation include “Estimated project duration” and “Ground floor area”, while others like “Below-ground floors” have minimal impact. The study highlights the interaction of various feature groups on prediction outcomes. Through feature interaction analysis, it is found that the Estimated project duration and Building architecture can have some negative correlation interaction.

In addition to the intrinsic forecasting difficulties at a planning level characterized by a limited level of knowledge of the artefact to be recovered, and a certain terminological confusion especially in professional contexts, there is also limited attention to this issue in the scientific field, which is further reduced since the dynamism of the construction sector and its weight within the Italian economic system decreased. These conditions are even more accentuated in the case of historic building heritage, due to the well-known difficulties in generalizing situations. A further, significant limitation of the parametric tools currently available is the absence of connections with the Life Cycle Cost. At this point, it seems clear that structural monitoring of cultural heritage is crucial not just for to ensure public safety and environmental protection, but also and above all for verifying the economic feasibility. In fact, it helps identify potential issues and defects in structures, enabling the implementation of preventive actions to avert failures or breakages. The advent of drones has streamlined this process, allowing for more detailed analysis while reducing costs and time. Therefore, the use of an automated system for detecting and monitoring structural degradation, consent an easier data collection, processing, and forecasting. With rare exceptions, estimating studies have often looked more deeply into the topic of cost estimation in the executive project phase, in which the level of information is objectively much more detailed. This contribution constitutes the start of a research path which, starting from the recognition of existing literature, aims to develop a tool for rapidly estimating costs in the feasibility project phase of restoration interventions on historic real estate, combining, from a structural point of view, the use of an automated system for detecting and monitoring structural degradation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Studies show that accounting for uncertainties in time and cost estimation of such projects can help the decision-makers in better understanding the involved risks. Several probabilistic models have been developed during the last two decades to facilitate such estimations. A common aspect of all these models is the subjective assessment of unit activities' duration, which affects the accuracy of the estimated time and cost significantly. Despite this, the mechanism governing the variability of unit activities' duration has seldom been studied. Thus this paper focuses on addressing this gap by using a unique set of data from a tunnel project. The variability in unit activities' duration (construction performance variability) is governed by three main components: typical performance variability, minor machinery delays and minor performance delays. Using these components, a novel method for modelling construction performance variability in probabilistic time estimation of tunnelling projects is proposed. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case example with a discussion on its important aspects, advantages and limitations. The findings of this paper offer a resource to improve the accuracy of time estimation for tunnelling projects. © 2024 The Author(s).

The best choice of aggregates for asphalt concrete production contributes significantly to road pavement stability, sustainability, and durability at its serviceability lifestyle. The use of critical design and analysis techniques for the production of asphalt concrete is one of the standard means of eradicating the defect of roads’ pavement deformation in the global construction industries. This study reveals the hidden knowledge about the standard formulation and mix design required for producing durable asphaltic concrete pavements. In the experiment, three different mix designs were used to make quality asphalt concrete for the road’s binder pavement construction. This was done to ascertain the best quality aggregates required to produce durable asphalt concrete to construct binder road’s pavement. Also, the aggregates used for the production of quality asphalt concrete for the construction of road’s wearing course pavements were formulated using two mix designs. The results of the experiments proved that the asphalt concrete made with the aggregate formulated for the binder course from the first mix design yielded the best outcome, which is suggested for the global production of quality and standard asphalt concrete for road’ binder pavements’ construction. Although the formulated aggregates for the wearing course’s asphalt production were made from the two mix designs, however, the obtained results from the first mix design were satisfactory fell within the specified limits. This made it the best mix design for industrial practice. In addition, the accuracy and efficiency of the results obtained relied so much on the standard of estimation made to produce quality asphalt concrete, which cost up to $270,830.00 at Chainages 26 + 700 to 26 + 925. All the experimental results proved that application of standard aggregates’ mix design in road pavement construction helps in preventing the problems of deformation, cracks, and other defects on the roads’ pavement system. Also, applying the first formulated mix design used in this study will help in maintaining the sustainable, durable, stable, and flexible road pavement in the global communities. Likewise, the government's constant expenditure on road pavement maintenance will be reduced. © 2024, Kare Publishing. All rights reserved."

However, limited research was conducted to investigate the life-cycle benefits of the full and partial self-centering structural systems on the life-cycle span, figuring out a more cost-effective solution for enhancing the building's seismic resilience. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the life-cycle benefits of full and partial self-centering structural systems compared to conventional buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs) using the life-cycle cost estimation method. The influences of the residual inter-story drift limit for demolition, the initial cost of emerging self-centering members, the value of building contents, and the discount rate were particularly investigated. To this end, three building structures with BRBFs and full and partial self-centering structural systems were designed to achieve the same capacity for controlling maximum inter-story drifts. Comprehensive dynamic analyses were performed to generate engineering parameters under different seismic intensities and the modeling uncertainties were properly considered through Monte Carlo simulation. The revised HAZUS loss calculation method was adopted to investigate the seismic annual loss (SAL) and life-cycle cost. The analysis results indicate that the partial self-centering behavior would be a better choice than the full self-centering behavior for developing the self-centering structural systems to achieve better life-cycle benefits. Moreover, it is essential and urgent to reduce the initial costs of self-centering structural members and control the floor acceleration responses for increasing the life-cycle benefits of self-centering structural systems and promoting their practical applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

This area of research focuses on finding solutions to challenging situations that are often difficult to resolve using traditional methods. Expert systems have widespread applications in the field of construction. The paper presents some of these applications, including their use in building maintenance, inspection of water and sewage systems, geotechnical engineering, road maintenance, and the selection of appropriate construction materials. Artificial neural networks are effective in optimizing financial plans, estimating the duration of activities, assessing the productivity of work teams, and selecting contractors. Genetic algorithms find their application in resource allocation, selecting optimal solutions for task scheduling and project costs, as well as in building maintenance, while fuzzy logic aids in risk analysis, project management, and cost estimation. Expert methods can be integrated into information systems to provide consistent information necessary for the effective management of construction projects. A review of published papers on the application of expert methods in construction shows that these methods are already significantly represented across all sectors of the construction industry, but also indicates that there are still substantial opportunities for their future application. © 2024, Croatian Association of Civil Engineers.

This article addresses large-scale wind power transmission scenarios both offshore and onshore. Based on the analysis of technical principles and engineering cost estimation data, it has designed 12 corresponding technical schemes for six advanced wind power collection and transmission methods from both technical and economic dimensions. A scenario with a transmission capacity of 1000MW was selected to conduct a comparative analysis of various types of power transmission technology schemes. The article provides a detailed exposition of the transmission capacity, reactive power compensation requirements, technical maturity, adaptability to scenarios, and economic viability for each scheme, and analyzes the technical and economic characteristics of each scheme. The research results indicate that the diode rectifier transmission scheme has the best economic performance, the VSC transmission scheme is the most technically mature, and the flexible low-frequency transmission scheme has certain economic advantages at medium and short distances. The diode parallel MMC and cascaded MMC schemes are economically second only to the diode rectifier scheme and also have the feature of not requiring wind farm networking.

Construction violations are an important issue for municipalities that can threaten building structures in a city. The traditional methods that are used today to control constructions are very time-consuming and expensive. The main goal of this research is to provide a new framework for quick and low-cost estimation, in revealing and monitoring constructions and identifying unauthorized urban buildings using Sentinel-1 satellite images in the period from 2017 to 2022 and spatial information systems. For this purpose, in the first step, based on the analysis and processing in SNAP software, the Sigma-Notch dispersion coefficient of the images was extracted and separated into two floors of buildings and non-buildings, and a threshold limit of more than 0.01 was obtained. Then, by using pixel based algorithm, the binary image of building and non-building was prepared as zero and one, and based on the difference between the two images, the area where the construction was done was determined. After revealing the changed construction areas, they were classified into three classes (building, under construction, and other lands) using maximum likelihood classification algorithms and random forest, and were evaluated with a field survey map and unlicensed parcels. The results showed that the number of unlicensed buildings using the maximum likelihood algorithm, random forest and field sampling is 97,135 and 48, respectively; Also, the accuracy of the maximum likelihood method was 0.89% and the kappa coefficient was 0.83% compared to the random forest method with the overall accuracy of 0.86 and the kappa coefficient was 0.81%. © 2023 by the authors."

In the public works field, the correct planning and estimation of costs allows an effective and efficient allocation of public economic resources and respect for deadlines, which have a great importance for works destined to essential public services. The last Italian legislation about the planning and construction of public works (Legislative Decree n. 50/2016) has introduced some changes relating the economic planning and cost estimation, the Article n. 23—paragraph 7 establishes that the definitive project of a public work must contain “definitive quantification of the expenditure limit for the realization and the relative time schedule, through the use, where existing, of the price lists prepared by the territorially competent regions and autonomous provinces, in agreement with the Italian territorial divisions of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport”. The reference to the regional price lists for the evaluation of the economic amount of a public work (project) aims to establish a single tool for the different operators (public administrators, designers, construction companies, etc.) who have to plan and estimate the costs of the project since the early phases of the design. Unlike the recent past, where the cost estimate of a public (and private) work could be made using municipal or provincial price lists, nowadays the price lists by Italian regions must be taken as a reference. The aim of the legislator is to take as a reference, in the economic planning phase, a single tool for estimating costs, sufficiently representative of the various cost formation functions in the building sector and to consider the specificities of local economic and productive realities. At this time, all Italian regions have a regional Price List which replace those developed on a local basis; their use to estimate the cost to be assumed as a basis for the tender has eliminated the problem of estimating, for the same project, different costs depending on the local Price List utilized. For a public work, any differences of the construction cost estimated in the design phase can be justified only by the different location of the work at a regional level and no longer provincial or municipal level. Taking as reference a case study relating to the construction of a medium-sized hospital (300 beds), this study aims to develop a comparison of unit costs derived from the analysis of the price lists of twenty Italian regions. The aim is to verify whether, for the same project, the construction costs of the main workings vary in relation to the regional location and what is the average difference. This is important not only for an efficient economic planning of public works by local and national public administrations (preparation of the necessary budget, etc.) but also for a more effective control of the differences between the initial and final budgets.

Inaccurate cost estimation can impact progress and result in budget overruns. The story point estimation technique is a commonly used practice in agile software development for the estimation of software development effort. It allows for the evaluation of relative task workloads by analyzing task titles and descriptions. In previous studies, researchers have mainly focused on providing story point estimation results by task titles. However, in practical scenarios, users are often unable to provide task titles as precise as those found in the training dataset, leading to inaccurate estimation results. To address this problem, we propose a Cooperative Reasoning Story Point estimation method (CRSP). We approach the estimation problem as a question-and-answer challenge, addressing it through a framework of model construction, Monte Carlo Tree search, and model inference. In the model construction phase, we train a generator responsible for generating problem-solving reasoning paths and employ verifier to score the quality of these reasoning paths. During the Monte Carlo Tree search stage, we execute MCTS using generator and verifier to generate candidate solutions. In the final model inference phase, we employ a solver to derive the ultimate answer. To evaluate the effectiveness of CRSP, we modify and adapt the well-known JIRA dataset to make it more compatible with the input format of the question-answering model. The new JIRA dataset contains 21,082 issues from 16 open-source software projects. Across 16 open-source projects, the mean absolute error of CRSP is lower than other baseline methods. In contrast to the traditional regression and classification methods, we pioneer the use of question-and-answer method to address the issue, opening up new directions for future research.  © 2024 ACM."

Although the construction and demolition waste is well-documented in the literature, the maintenance phase could benefit from more academic research. Maintenance waste could be managed based on a linear economy or a circular economy. Since the existing linear economy poses significant problems, a transition to a circular economy is necessary. Such a transition is in its infancy stage and is hindered by multiple barriers. This paper developed a practical methodology for this transition and demonstrated its advantages to encourage its adoption by the building industry. These advantages included increasing the accuracy of building maintenance cost estimation, reducing the possibility of maintenance cost over-estimation, and reducing the waste of maintenance resources. These advantages were mostly due to replacing the deterministic and probabilistic maintenance cost estimation models with a machine-learning-based methodology. This methodology was shown to be versatile in several areas of application, i.e. anomaly detection, feature engineering, cost estimation, and validation. The methodology could be applied to any building type in any geographic location.

XGBoost model was used to estimate construction cost and compared with two common artificial intelligence algorithms: extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression spline model. Statistical indicators showed that XGBoost algorithm achieved the best performance with a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.952) and root mean square error (RMSE = 590,609.782).

Government policies in several developed countries have begun to increase the implementation of green retrofitting buildings in those countries, which must rise by up to 2.5% of the lifespan of buildings by 2030. By 2050, it is hoped that more than 85% of all buildings will have been retrofitted. The high costs of implementing green retrofitting amounting to 20% of the total initial construction costs, as well as the uncertainty of costs due to cost overruns are one of the main problems in achieving the implementation target in 2050. Therefore, increasing the accuracy of the costs of implementing green retrofitting is the best solution to overcome this. This research is limited to analyzing the factors that influence increasing the accuracy of green retrofitting costs based on WBS, BIM, and Information Systems. The results show that there are 10 factors affecting the cost accuracy of retrofitting or customizing high-rise office buildings, namely Energy Use Efficiency, Water Use Efficiency, Use of Environmentally Friendly Materials, Maintenance of Green Building Performance during the Use Period, Initial Survey, Project Information Documents, Cost Estimation Process, Resources, Legal, and Quantity Extraction applied.

One such technology is direct air capture (DAC), an innovative negative CO2 emission technology in its early stages of commercialization. Through DAC, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere can be effectively reduced, and the captured CO2 can be utilized to create products such as construction materials and synthetic fuels. Currently, there is no method or tool available to assess the viability of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) projects accurately. Therefore, we propose the development of an easy-to-use tool and method that will ensure a certain degree of accuracy for early-stage investment decisions for CCU projects.

It is an essential decision support methodology for selection, design, development, construction, and maintenance of railway infrastructure system. Effective implementation of LCC analysis will assure cost-effective operation of railways from both investment and life-cycle perspectives. A major setback in the successful implementation of LCC by infrastructure managers is the availability of relevant, reliable, and structured data. Another challenge is the prediction of future behaviour of railway system with a change in the design or operation parameters. Different cost estimation methods and prediction models have been developed to deal with both challenges. However, there is a need to integrate prediction models as an integral part of LCC methodology, to account for possible changes in the model variables. This article presents an LCC based approach for requirement specification. It integrates degradation models with an LCC model to study the impact of change in design speed on key decision criteria such as track possession time, service life of track system, and LCC. The methodology is applied to an ongoing railway investment project in Sweden to investigate and quantify the impact of design speed change from 250 to 320 km/h. This is carried out to support specification of technical requirement for the design of track system. The results from the studied degradation models show that the correction factor for a change in speed varies between 0,79 and 0,96. Using this correction factor to compensate for changes in design speed, the service life of ballasted track system is estimated to decrease by an average of 15% from 30 years to approximately 25 years. Further, the LCC of the route under consideration will increase by an expected value of 30%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

To facilitate the selection and purchase of houses by clients, construction companies usually use sample houses, models, or videos to show the appearance of new houses being constructed. Clients have numerous opportunities to participate in the spatial planning and spatial allocation of the houses because these houses have not yet been constructed, and clients can direct the style and materials used for interior partition walls and furnishings. However, when discussing housing styles with their clients, construction companies often depend on their imagination to create three-dimensional images depicting the interior layout of houses. Construction companies can neither immediately present new styles when clients request changes to partition walls or styles nor estimate the costs of the changes. Consequently, clients cannot immediately decide on such changes, which then leads to poor communication between the two parties. Accordingly, this study designed a system that integrates building information modeling (BIM) and virtual reality (VR). Through this system, clients can change and immediately view house styles in immersive VR and decide on whether the changes meet their demands. Furthermore, the designed system is linked to a unit price database for materials. When clients make alterations in the system, it automatically calculates the costs of the changes and then helps the client determine whether the changes are within their budgets. The results of this study indicate that the designed system can accurately and rapidly achieve cost estimation. Furthermore, the proposed system ensures consistency between BIM and virtual environment information, thereby promoting the application of BIM in the stages of a building life cycle subsequent to building design. © 2023, Korean Society of Civil Engineers."

The proposed model consists of two separate modules. The first accounts for the probabilistic estimation of material quantities and their relative costs during the construction phase, specifically for the bridge’s superstructure and foundation. The second one refers to the operational phase of the bridge’s components. For illustrative purposes, the maintenance costs of deck expansion joints are presented, as they are regarded as vulnerable bridge components with regular repairs. The suggested DBN includes time-dependent and continuous variables thoroughly documented over multiple time stages.

Most of the information during this stage is qualitative, posing additional challenges to achieving accurate cost estimates. Additionally, there is a lack of tools that use qualitative project information and forecast the budgets required for project completion. This research, therefore, aims to develop a model for setting project budgets (excluding land) during the pre-conceptual stage of residential buildings, where project information is mainly qualitative. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the qualitative nature of project information at the pre-conception stage, a natural language processing model, DistilBERT (Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), was trained to predict the cost range of residential buildings at the pre-conception stage. The training and evaluation data included 63,899 building permit activity records (2021–2022) from the Victorian State Building Authority, Australia. The input data comprised the project description of each record, which included project location and basic material types (floor, frame, roofing, and external wall). Findings: This research designed a novel tool for predicting the project budget based on preliminary project information. The model achieved 79% accuracy in classifying residential buildings into three cost_classes ($100,000-$300,000, $300,000-$500,000, $500,000-$1,200,000) and F1-scores of 0.85, 0.73, and 0.74, respectively. Additionally, the results show that the model learnt the contextual relationship between qualitative data like project location and cost. Research limitations/implications: The current model was developed using data from Victoria state in Australia; hence, it would not return relevant outcomes for other contexts. However, future studies can adopt the methods to develop similar models for their context. Originality/value: This research is the first to leverage a deep learning model, DistilBERT, for cost estimation at the pre-conception stage using basic project information like location and material types. Therefore, the model would contribute to overcoming data limitations for cost estimation at the pre-conception stage. Residential building stakeholders, like clients, designers, and estimators, can use the model to forecast the project budget at the pre-conception stage to facilitate decision-making. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Awareness of the importance of considering future operation and demolition costs emphasises the shortcomings related to the possibility of making accurate predictions/estimations of such costs, which will become apparent in the future. To address this research gap, an innovative approach of life-cycle cost modelling on the level of individual structures of the building is presented. The model provides users with information on the costs of available technical solutions resulting from the requirements of the investor at a specific stage of the construction project. In this way, it helps investors optimise their building projects and to find the most economical solutions. Specifically, this model is assembled for the purpose of selecting a suitable partition wall and, therefore, it takes into consideration specific characteristics relating to this particular type of structure. The results indicate diversity in partition wall structural design variants at the early stage of the project. Since the ability to influence future costs decreases as the project progresses, the model allows capturing LCC perspective even if only a construction study is available without more detailed technical and economic information.

To obtain strengthening cost, 377 reinforced concrete buildings which have been designed according to the 1975, 1997 and 2007 Turkish Earthquake Codes have been checked and strengthened according to the new code 2018 Turkish Earthquake Code. After that, to obtain the total cost (rough total construction cost) of the buildings according to the new code, 84 different reinforced concrete buildings have been designed according to the 2018 Turkish Earthquake Code. The professional program Sta4CAD has been used to model, analyze and strengthening those reinforced concrete buildings. When the old buildings are checked according to the new code, they may not satisfy the conditions of the code since the new code has more general rules. According to that, those old buildings will need strengthening. Section enlargement method, addition of shear wall and other methods have been used so that the old buildings can satisfy the new code provisions. For strengthening cost of Reinforced Concrete buildings, 13 parameters have been chosen accordingly. The output parameter for the study is the strengthening cost, which are in Turkish Lira according to the unit prices of materials in Turkey. For rough total cost according to TEC 2018 8 parameters have been used. According to the study, the prediction accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network that has been trained, was found to be 94% accuracy for the strengthening cost. However in the regression analysis method, 71% accuracy has been found. For total cost, Artificial Neural Network gave 97% accuracy and for regression analysis method 95% accuracy has been found. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

The BIM manager has the responsibility to coordinate all tasks involved in a building design, as well as the associated activities usually that are normally worked-out, complementing the project. During the development of a project, a BIM manager can access various discipline models, located in a delayering shared platform, and request responsibilities and amendments if inconsistencies are detected.

This paper develops an integrated framework to automatically extract and visualize construction quantities from BIM models. The system includes a Quantity Precision Check (QPC) module for automating more accurate QTO outputs. These outputs are then automatically transferred to an external database and visualized through a user-friendly dashboard on the Microsoft Power BI platform. This dashboard allows for comparisons between 2-D and BIM quantities and helps track changes in quantities over time due to design changes. The system was successfully validated in an infrastructure construction project in Canada, where it identified a 39% inconsistency in wall elements' material quantities and reduced steel quantity by 10% due to design changes. Overall, the system offers a speedy, reliable, and efficient tool for construction estimators, site managers, and cost control teams to provide accurate quantities to the procurement team and make swift decisions in response to design change impacts on construction costs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

This study aims to calculate the RBM performance considering the geometric parameters of drilling and based on the geomechanical properties of the rock. In this research, drilling the chief shaft in the Azad Dam in Iran has been evaluated using theoretical approaches and the cutting geometry of cutters. Shaft depth and diameter are 510 and 1.5 meters, respectively. The findings of this study showed that the rates of thrust force, machine power, and predicted torque are 4116KN, 125KW, and 199KNm, respectively, which are close to the actual value and proportional to the capacity of RBM. As a result, the device’s operating parameters have been compatible with the characteristics of the rock mass. Results showed that the rock’s uniaxial compressive strength and the roller cutter’s characteristics could determine the thrust rate behind the spindle and the amount of torque required.

Notably, cost overrun prediction model development can help identify factors that lead to cost overruns, thereby substantially improving cost estimates. Meanwhile, a machine learning application on archival data to estimate construction cost overrun is still in development. Motivated by this, we applied an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine to analyze historical data of construction projects in Ghana completed between 2016 and 2018. The comparison between the actual and predicted cost yielded a good model prediction. The RMSE, MSE, MAE, and MAPE values are 0.202, 0.041, 0.069, and 0.306, respectively. To visually explain the importance of each feature for cost overrun prediction, we used SHAP values to illustrate the effect of each feature for model interpretability. According to SHAP ranking, we discover that the initial contract amount, the number of storeys, scope changes, and the initial duration are the variables that most accurately predict project completion costs and cost overruns.

Thus, to provide a novel solution, the principles of Construction 4.0 were integrated with a versatile sustainable bridge design model, developed by the authors to be used at the conceptual design stage of bridges. The said model consists of a rule-based expert system and four modules, namely: bridge sustainability rating system (BrSRS), bridge environmental performance strategy mapping (BrEPSM), 3D (3-dimensional) modeling, and conceptual cost estimating. The three (3) core principles of Construction 4.0 (smart technologies; simulation and modeling; and digitization and virtualization) are compatible with the current model’s architecture, function, and purpose.

In this context, the concept of ""green building construction"" has emerged as a game-changer, prioritizing occupant well-being, resource conservation, and energy efficiency. However, due to the relatively new nature of green building construction, stakeholders often face difficulties in accurately estimating project costs. This challenge stems from the inherent differences between green and conventional building projects, as green buildings incorporate innovative technologies and design elements to achieve environmental and social benefits, requiring a more complex approach to cost estimation than traditional construction methods. One of the significant challenges in green building projects is the potential for inaccurate cost and schedule estimations, leading to cost overruns and delays, which ultimately impact project performance. To address this issue, this research focuses on utilizing historical data from government green building projects in India to train machine learning models, specifically random forests for predicting project costs based on various project parameters. Those parameters include project type, built-up area, energy use, water use, green building rating, estimated cost, and final cost.

By increasing the productivity of construction projects, Building Information Modelling (BIM) is causing a radical shift in the construction industry. BIM was introduced to accelerate the development of the construction industry. There is a need for BIM-based measurement to automate the taking-off process, which increases productivity and reduces human error in measurement and cost estimation. However, BIM-based measurement has not yet been widely adopted by the Quantity Surveying profession. The need for BIM-based measurement in the construction industry must be increased. Thus, this research examined BIM-based measurement's technical constraints and improved it based on the identified technical constraints. The case study approach was adopted, and a recent condominium project in Kuala Lumpur was used to quantify the outputs of this research, resulting in a more practical view of BIM-based measurement. The research compared the differences in quantities and identified the BIM-based measurement constraints through a quantity take-off process following the Standard Methods of Measurement Building Works 2nd Edition (SMM 2). The analysis indicated that technical constraints such as BIM component misconnection, software interoperability, high hardware requirement, and lack of BIM standard rules are affecting BIM-based measurement in the Quantity Surveying (QS) profession. To minimise the identified constraints, construction players are suggested to check for the models to prevent overlapping problems, incorporate different types of software in BIM measurement, and implement the BIM execution plan at the early stage of the construction. The findings can assist professional construction players in understanding the differences between manual and BIM-based measurements to develop their measurement protocols and strategies to minimise BIM-based measurement constraints, indirectly strengthening their professional competencies in this essential digital era. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University."

Prior to starting a TBM project, performance analysis is a crucial stage necessary to inform the initial investment decision and project cost estimation. However, this analysis requires extensive fieldwork and laboratory studies. The Advance Rate (AR), calculated from the Utilization Factor (U)–the ratio of excavation time to total project time–is a widely accepted measure of TBM performance. Total project time encompasses various parameters, including boring time, cutter inspection and replacement times, and constant factors like re-gripping, service, and maintenance times. In this study, we employed analytical methods, statistical analysis, and genetic programming approaches to evaluate the AR and thus enhance TBM performance analysis. Gamma tests were conducted to identify interrelated parameters in TBM operations. The results from these tests showed that the Applied Force per Cutter (FN) and penetration values (together forming the Field Penetration Index or FPI) are useful in estimating cutter consumption. While FN can be determined through laboratory tests, its field determination is challenging. We have developed several charts and a function derived from genetic programming to estimate the AR of a TBM. The study demonstrated that this function, formulated using genetic programming, possesses strong predictive capability and can significantly improve TBM performance analysis. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

On one hand, there has been significant progress in developing regulatory and technical documentation for cultural heritage sites and their conservation. However, on the other hand, there is an issue with outdated cost estimation methods and normative frameworks for determining the costs, as well. Hence, the role of environmental impact on the cultural heritage sites is underestimated. This problem leads to the need to develop scientific and methodological tools for the implementation of projects for the reconstruction of the cultural heritage sites considering the reduction of the impact of harsh environmental conditions. The authors proposed a logical research design, developed and improved methodological tools for selecting projects for the conservation of cultural heritage sites and assessing the impact of local environment, and tested the proposed methodological tools using the example of a project for the reconstruction of a cultural heritage site in the Moscow region.

Such information is critical for the early conceptual and design phases when key choices must be made. Numerous variables influence the cost of tunnel construction, and limited information is available at the early stages of design when the possible use of tunnels is being studied. Therefore, there is a limited number of models at engineers’ disposal to develop a proper cost estimate for tunneling projects. This study aimed to offer a model for estimating the construction cost of drilling and blasting tunnels in the preliminary stage of a project. For this purpose, an optimized gene expression programming (GEP) method was used based on the study of 900 data points obtained from ten drilling and blasting tunnels, which were randomly split into the training (800 data points) and testing (100 data points) datasets. With the experience of previously constructed tunnels, eleven parameters were considered the most effective for the tunnel's construction cost. The best fit on predictions generated an equation for the optimized GEP model. Finally, by comparing the equation's outputs with the actual costs and its behavior with practice, its potential ability to estimate the construction cost of drilling and blasting tunnels was approved. Moreover, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the GEP model was created as a practical tool for estimating the construction cost of tunnels. This model can reduce tunnel uncertainties and give ML development in tunnel planning. © 2023"

Following the qualitative approach, data were collected through eleven semi-structured expert interviews. Experts were selected through purposive sampling followed by snowball sampling. The data analysis was conducted through manual content analysis. Findings revealed context, features of 5D-BIM-based quantity calculation which solve the problems of conventional methods in the Sri Lankan context which includes high time consuming, lesser accuracy, minimal collaboration, inefficient for preliminary stage estimating and inefficient for cost planning with cross-reference to the findings in the literature review. In addition to the findings in the literature review respondents were suggested problems in conventional methods in Sri Lanka and how those problems can be addressed through key features of the 5D-BIM approach. © 2024, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

Despite efforts to mitigate climate change, the construction industry faces a critical gap in effectively evaluating the carbon emissions and costing it. The major reasons could be attributed to lack of awareness of carbon performance and commitment, lack of data availability and inconsistent methodologies. Hence, this study aims to develop a simplified guide, as an extension to the typical cost estimation practice towards addressing the above concerns with respect to embodied carbon (EC). This study primarily involved a quantitative assessment of EC emission of a typical high-rise residential building in Sri Lanka. Therefore, BOQ of the selected building and additional information such as material and machinery requirements, EC co-efficient, fuel consumption and transportation distance were obtained from technical specifications, industry practiced norms and databases. Accordingly, the EC emission of the selected building was derived as 873KgCO2/m2 of GFA. Of this, 94% is due to material production stage, while remaining 6% is in transportation and construction stages. Key materials contributed include: paint, cement and reinforcement. The steps followed in deriving the above estimation is presented as a simplified guide that would promote and account the construction clients for the EC emission of their proposed building constructions. By integrating EC assessment (ECA) into the construction cost estimation process, this guide seeks to empower decision-makers to choose among carbon alternatives and aid in carbon taxation in the Sri Lankan context. © 2024, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

Accurate estimation results are critical for database administrators or database management systems to perform query processing or optimization tasks. An efficient and accurate estimation model can improve the estimation quality and make the produced results credible. Although learning-based methods have been applied in query cost estimation, most of them are directed at relational queries and cannot be directly used for graph queries. Furthermore, most estimation approaches focus on the correlations between predicates or columns. The dependencies between query schema and query filter conditions and the correlation between query schema are ignored. In this study, we construct a novel deep learning model composed of reasoning and retrieval processes that can accurately capture the potential logical relationships in graph queries. This solves the above problems to some extent. In addition, we propose a query estimation framework that divides the estimation task into query workload generation, training data collection, feature extraction and encoding, and estimation model construction.

In particular, transportation infrastructure (TI) projects, such as roads and bridges, are vastly affected by cost overruns, which can delay the entire project. This research intends to identify the factors affecting the cost overruns in New Zealand (NZ) TI projects. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted using a questionnaire survey involving ninety-two participants experienced in infrastructure project estimation in NZ. Quantitative methods were used to analyse the data. Findings: Fifty-three factors were identified through literature under ten categories. Based on the survey, ten significant factors were identified with a high grade of importance. The three most critical factors were “frequent design changes,” “poor planning and scheduling” and “inadequate tender documentation.” It was found that the cost overrun is primarily affected by the pre-contract stage causes. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from professionals involved in NZTI projects. Therefore, the implications may be different for other contexts. Practical implications: The results will improve the current estimation practice by developing a new statistical model considering all the significant variables for NZTI projects. Originality/value: Although much research is done to identify these factors, they are only considered in a few statistical cost models.

Climate change is a significant issue, that especially affects the construction industry. It is very important that bridges are able to withstand the impacts of climate change and adaptation measures will be required to achieve this. Methods: The digital twin will be developed using BIM to manage the climate change adaptation measures for the bridges. A 6D BIM model will be created that includes the 3D Revit model of a bridge featuring climate change measures, the climate change adaptation measures timeline schedule, climate change adaptation cost estimation, and carbon emission estimation, which will be produced using Revit software, Navisworks, and Granta EduPack. The results will show how 6D BIM can be used to support the adaptation of bridges to the effects of climate change. Results: The findings underscore the efficacy of 6D BIM in enhancing bridge resilience against climate change impacts. The 3D model demonstrates integration of adaptation measures without compromising bridge functionality. Moreover, the 4D model's timeline scheduling facilitates hazard anticipation, project planning, communication enhancement, collaborative efforts, and project visualization.

It is an essential decision support methodology for selection, design, development, construction, maintenance and renewal of railway infrastructure system. Effective implementation of LCC analysis will assure cost-effective operation of railways from both investment and life-cycle perspectives. A major setback in the successful implementation of LCC analysis by infrastructure managers is the availability of relevant, reliable, and structured data. Different cost estimation methods and prediction models have been developed to deal with this challenge. However, there is a need to include condition degradation models as an integral part of LCC model to account for possible changes in the model variables. This article presents an approach for integrating degradation models with LCC model to study the impact of change in design speed on key decision criteria such as track possession time, service life of track system, and LCC. The methodology is applied to an ongoing railway investment project in Sweden to investigate and quantify the impact of design speed change from 250 to 320 km/h. The results of the studied degradation models show that the intended change in speed corresponds to correction factor values between 0.79 and 0.96. Using this correction factor to compensate for changes in design speed, the service life of ballasted track system is estimated to decrease by an average of 15%. Further, the expected value of LCC for the route under consideration will increase by 30%. The outcome of this study will be used to support the design and requirement specification of railway track system for the project under consideration. © The Author(s) 2024."

The goal of this study is to identify the main factors that affect cost compliance and to assess how relevant these factors are from the perspectives of clients, contractors, and consultants in construction firms in Iraq. For the purpose of this study, 100 structured questionnaires were distributed to clients, contractors, and consultants on building sites throughout the study area by using the survey approach. The Relative Importance Index (RII) technique was used for the analysis. It has been determined that the factors potentially affecting cost management in construction firms should be taken into consideration during the planning, design, tendering, and construction stages to accomplish the project within the specified time and cost. Twenty factors that affected the performance of construction firms in Iraq were identified. The results revealed the most affecting factor was poor management/poor coordination between the contracting company and the authorities involved, followed by the nationality of workers, structural materials damaged during storage, the absence of places designated for storing materials, lack of personnel specializing in devices and equipment, changing labor and material prices as a result of political changes, lack of technical staff, length of the project period, mismatch designs with execution works in site, and changes in orders. The study concludes by stating that there is not an efficient procedure in Iraq to control cost management. © 2023, Dr D. Pylarinos. All rights reserved."

In this research, a wastewater treatment system made up of a sedimentation tank, a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF-CW), a vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland (VF-CW), and a storage tank was proposed, designed, and cost estimated. Small populations in underdeveloped nations with dry and semi-arid climates can use the treatment system as an affordable construction, maintenance, and operational solution for wastewater treatment. The system will protect agricultural lands and groundwater from pollution. The system can service 6000 capita and has a wastewater discharge of 780 m3/d in the developing arid region in El-Moghra Oasis western desert of Egypt, where the 1.5 million acres used for the land reclamation project based on groundwater irrigation. The relaxed tanks in a series model based on the areal loading rates and background pollutants concentrations (P-K-C*) was utilized to size the HSSF and VF-CWs. The results indicated that the HSSF-CW design treatment surface area was 2375 m2, and the hydraulic surface loading (q) and hydraulic retention time (RT) were 0.33 m/d and 0.55 d, respectively, and utilizing Phragmites australis and Papyrus for the biological treatment. The expected overall cumulative removal efficiencies were 96.7, 70, and 100% for the biological oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphors (TP), and fecal coliforms (FC), respectively. The VF-CW indicates that there was a 2193 m2 design treatment surface area, q = 0.36 m/d, and RT of 0.63 d. The expected BOD, TP, and FC removal efficiencies were 75, 33.3, and 92.7%, respectively. In order to simplify the design stages and the cost estimation, design and investment cost curves were established for a population range from 500 to 9000. The total monthly water loss due to evapotranspiration for the HSSF and VF-CWs indicates a range from 3.7 to 8.5%, respectively. The total investment cost analysis for the proposed system corresponding to 780 m3/d wastewater discharge of indicates a total investment cost of EUR 146,804 and EUR 24.46/per-capita equivalent (P.E).

Decentralized data storages make data engineering a challenging task, highlighting a recognizable shortage of harnessing data from these data storages, and using ML to optimize estimations for large EPC projects. Empowering proposal teams by using ML-based tools on the engineering disciplines data from previously executed projects can help them make better cost estimates and more informed decisions during project execution. Methods, Procedures, Process: The McDermott AI team and domain Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) worked together to improve the process of using initial bills of quantities (BOQ)/Material take-off (MTO) for cost estimation during early stages of the project bidding. We combined the knowledge of EPC engineering experience and data into a real-life application - a ML-based multilinear regression application to predict MTO quantities for different engineering disciplines using MTO data from previously executed projects within the company. The database was developed by compiling MTO data from past projects and applying feature engineering on it. An example material quantity prediction is in Figure 1. Results and Conclusions: As organizations look to modernize and optimize processes, ML is an increasingly powerful tool to drive automation. Unlike basic, rule- based automation;which is typically used for standardized, predictable processes;ML can handle more complex processes and learn over time, leading to greater improvements in accuracy and efficiency. The developed ML-based software can help proposal teams to improve initial cost estimates for engineering disciplines key quantities. In addition to this, in the paper we also share our experience and lessons learnt on how to prepare database from decentralized data banks, and how we can pre-process this data for our machine learning model. Novel/Technical contributions: The main aim of the developed ML solution is to harness the power of EPC project data and experience to improve work hour or cost estimation for engineering disciplines. The model has been developed using data from different types of EPC projects executed all around the world. This also presents a case on why and how companies can best utilize the data which is usually stored in decentralized data storage. The solution can assist proposal teams to make better estimates for scope of work based on the type of project. This product could be potentially applied to any EPC company working on oil & gas or petrochemical plants. It could also motivate other practitioners and researchers to replicate the experience to develop a similar tailor-made ML solution for different industries. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers."

The purpose of this article is to introduce an intelligent model to improve modeling approaches accuracy throughout early phases of a project's development in the construction sector. A support vector machine model, which is computationally effective, is created to calculate the conceptual costs of building projects. To get accurate estimates, the suggested neural network model is trained using a cross-validation method. Through the research of the literature and interviews with experts, the cost estimate's influencing elements are determined. As training instances, the cost information from 40 structures is used. Two potent intelligence methods-Nonlinear Regression (NR) and Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Interface Model (EFNIM)- are offered to illustrate how well the suggested model performs. Based on the readily accessible dataset from the relevant literature in the construction business, their results are contrasted.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is one such critical approach that has demonstrated its considerable effectiveness in estimating cost and material quantities for large-scale projects, such as dams. This research investigates and assesses the essential role and contributions of BIM technology and associated software tools in estimating the cost of dam construction projects, characterized by their high complexity, intricate management, extended construction period, and substantial concrete and steel material requirements. A mixed-methods study incorporating three primary strategies was employed: (A) literature review, (B) quantitative research, and (C) qualitative research approaches. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and an online survey questionnaire. The key findings from this study's analysis (using an Iraqi dam as a case study) indicate that the implementation of BIM technology and software concepts is highly advantageous, dynamic, and effective in evaluating construction project budgets. Furthermore, the research highlights that accurately estimating the cost of dams can significantly reduce the time, financial investment, and effort needed to assess the budget of construction projects, particularly those involving dams with higher complexity, extended construction periods, challenging management, and intricate activities and tasks. Additionally, the use of BIM approaches was found to substantially mitigate human error in cost estimations and enhance the performance and accuracy of dam cost evaluations. © 2023, Mathematical Modelling of Engineering Problems.

From the initial project idea to detailed planning and legal approval, the costs of transport infrastructures play a decisive role for investors, authorities, and the public. Although each project is different and some deviations between estimation and actual costs are to be expected, there is ample evidence from the literature on systematic underestimation and the main reasons for this effect. Beyond investment costs, reliable estimations of life cycle costs from single assets and projects up to entire road networks are of an increasing importance to determine budgeting needs, preserve asset value, and define contracts between stakeholders. In all cases, systematic methods and a large database on road projects and individual measures are needed to provide a sufficient basis for cost estimations and validation. This paper tries to fill this gap by providing unit costs both at the project and asset level for construction and rehabilitation measures with adjusted prices for the year 2022. Thereby, the cost estimates are based on extensive research and collected cost data from projects on regional roads and highways in Austria over the last two decades. In addition, the paper presents calibrated standardized live cycle costs for key road assets together with life cycle cost factors providing the means to estimate life cycle costs based on construction costs alone. Finally, the adjustment of prices for different regions and years of construction are highlighted, allowing for a validation of individual project appraisals. © 2023 The Author(s)."

With the large-scale construction of charging stations, exploded EV buying rate, it results in increased power demand on local grids. Further, various direct, indirect, static, and dynamic factors involved in the usage and total charging cost estimation make it difficult for charging station owners, utility, and overall tedious user experience. In the future, EVSE load forecast and associated cost estimation, particularly a short-term forecast, will play a critical role in grid load planning, and the safe functioning of the electric power system while enhancing end user experience. AI-ML-driven and deep learning-based intelligent cost estimation engine proposed here will leverage the IOT connectivity for EV to forecast the load demand at charging station and efficient price estimation for EV charging.

In addition, a local cost estimation mechanism is introduced in the heuristic part of the transition probability, that is, the heuristic information not only considers the real cost caused by the current solution and the high priority neighbor, but also considers the cost estimation value of the current solution and the neighbor, which can better evaluate the local benefits. Finally, this paper verifies that the distributed constraint algorithm outperforms the existing distributed incomplete algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE."

Due to various factors, the cost estimation for the building's construction cannot be enhanced. The cost estimation in the Indonesian construction industry is unreliable for completing projects at contract costs. Less emphasis on the variable factor decreases the accuracy of the estimated cost. This study gathered construction sector management data to contribute empirical evidence to the literature. According to this study, cost estimators can considerably enhance cost estimation in the Indonesian construction industry, estimating methodology, project information, current data, and historical data. Since the explored factors for estimating building construction costs were not considered in previous studies, the model devised by this research is a significant contribution. The practical implications of this research are reliable for cost estimation in the building and other sectors to increase the accuracy of the estimated cost about the actual project cost. This research also provides prospective directions for incorporating new knowledge into the cost estimation model by determining the impact of other significant factors. © 2023 Editora Mundos Sociais.

In this study, for the evaluation of site amplification effects, we used the results of recent works based on the Italian seismic microzonation data. As this first study is performed for the entire Italian territory at the municipality scale, the site amplification factors (AFs) have been assigned to the chief town of each of the 7715 Italian municipalities, assuming that the building stock is concentrated in that small area. The AFs have been compared with those foreseen by the Italian building code (NTC2018). The PGA amplification with the new AFs ranges from 1 to 2.2 bringing to an average increase of 75% in the hazard, compared to 27% if using the NTC2018 amplification. The seismic risk has been evaluated using the probabilistic hazard assessment adopted in the NTC2018 and recent vulnerability/exposure models developed for Italy. The residential building stock was subdivided into 5 vulnerability classes (3 for masonry and 2 for concrete) derived from the national census data and further refined using the construction age and building height. The results show that, for a rock site condition, the loss estimates are comparable with those of previous works in terms of casualties, homeless, and economic damage. The introduction of the site effects brings to a significant increase in the expected losses resulting higher than the historical data retrieved from a careful analysis of the major Italian earthquakes. This suggests the importance of developing new fragility curves based on updated AFs. To support the implementation of risk reduction programs, a seismic risk index is introduced, allowing a municipality ranking by risk, a cost estimation of the seismic retrofitting in the highest risk municipalities, and an assessment of the consequent risk reduction. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Recently, active research has been conducted on the construction costs for basic type (CCBT) calculation to formulate appropriate policies. However, related previous studies have focused on improving the predictability of the construction cost in early stages based on existing house sale prices. In contrast, the CCBT calculation approach mainly requires policy implementation in practical fields, without considering the requirements of academics. Therefore, it is necessary to academically discuss a different approach for the estimation of sale prices of new MFH in the construction stage. This study aimed to calculate the CCBT to determine the appropriate sale price for new MFH. We selected four sample projects to calculate the CCBT, and a weighted average method was applied to correct regional deviations. Case application, which is a comparison between the CCBT-based sale price and actual case-based sale price, produced cost values in the range of 98–104%, and they included additional expenses. The results of this study demonstrate an extremely high level of cost estimation accuracy according to the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering study. Furthermore, this study can facilitate the stabilization of national housing by determining an appropriate sale price and can contribute to cost management research conducted during the construction phase. © 2022 by the authors."

Conventional methods of utility placement, i.e. open-cut trenching techniques, are expensive in terms of their many social, environmental, and indirect economic costs. This necessitates consideration of alternative construction methods such as Multi-Utility Tunnels (MUTs). However, a lack of quantification of their short-term and long-term costs and impacts (i.e. a comprehensive understanding of all the consequences of moving to MUTs) inhibits uptake. Carbon accounting, a globally important consideration, is increasingly adopted within the construction industry and could be used as a convincing argument for why alternatives such as MUTs might be a preferred method of utility placement in cities that are advancing global sustainability agendas. This paper compares carbon cost estimations of open-cut excavations with flush-fitting MUTs. The results show that although flush-fitting MUTs have much greater carbon footprints in the short-term compared to open-cut installation methods, they would save a considerable amount of carbon in the long-term (over their lifetime) by eliminating the need for numerous excavation and reinstatement (E&R) procedures, which are inevitable for repair and maintenance of buried utility services. The research reveals the tipping points in favour of flush-fitting MUTs, in terms of carbon saved, when repetitive E&R works are eradicated, to support their adoption. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering."

Whereas previous studies were mainly focused on achieving the highest possible estimation accuracy, this paper aims to propose cost-estimation models that can provide satisfactory accuracy with the least possible effort and to compare the perspectives of owners and contractors as the key stakeholders on projects. To determine cost drivers (CDs) that have a high influence on highway-construction costs and require low effort for their establishment, a questionnaire survey was conducted. Based on the key stakeholders’ perceptions and collected data set, cost-estimation models were developed using multiple-regression analysis, artificial neural networks, and XGBoost. The results show that reasonable cost-estimation accuracy can be achieved with relatively low effort for three CDs for the owners’ perspective and five CDs for the contractors’ perspective. Additional inclusion of input CDs in models does not necessarily imply an increase in accuracy. Also, the questionnaire results show that owners are more concerned about environmental issues, whereas contractors are more concerned about the possible changes in resource prices (especially after recent high increases caused by COVID-19 and the Russia–Ukraine war).

Firstly, probability distributions of material quantities and construction costs for the superstructure and foundation are estimated. Subsequently, the maintenance costs of deck expansion joints are illustratively presented, as they are considered vulnerable bridge elements with frequent repairs. The proposed DBN contains continuous and time-dependent variables thoroughly registered over multiple time stages. The DBN is formulated using actual records of 60 concrete bridges’ construction, inspections, condition and maintenance from the Egnatia Odos motorway in Greece. The presented approach is an effective tool for bridge management enhancement owing to stochastic dynamic interdependencies among parameters and continuous information updating. © 2023 The Author(s)."

The major research findings revealed that using the BIM technology via the REVIT software provided a more effective approach and practicality than manual calculations of steel, concrete, and other architectural components. In addition, the findings confirmed that the accuracy of cost estimation using BIM technology via REVIT software is better than manual calculations. The reason is the elimination of human errors during the calculations process. Thus, accurate results can be obtained from the REVIT software.

The effects of these uncertainties on the project objectives are different during each stage of its life cycle (design, construction, and operation). However, due to the high level of sustainability objectives, green building projects can face even more inaccurate cost estimation, uncertain workforce availability, and green material availability risks. Green building projects are reported to confront more risks than conventional buildings because of the need to achieve sustainability goals. This article aims to explore risk mitigation measures in green building projects. To accomplish this, we review the fundamental risk treatment strategies (avoidance, transference, mitigation, escalation, and acceptance) documented in ‘The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)’. We also review and analyse green building project case studies reported in the literature and the standard risk mitigation methods for green building projects. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Among them, the main contents of water conservancy development include accelerating the formulation of key river basin plans, studying and optimizing the operation and management of water conservancy stations in the basin, and improving the utilization efficiency of water energy resources. As a kind of stochastic global optimization technology, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm that appeared in recent years has the characteristics of simplicity, ease of operation, few empirical parameters, and fast convergence speed. Therefore, it is an ideal way to invert the physical and mechanical parameters of the dam based on the dam prototype monitoring data. To protect their own interests and solve the problem of construction funds, the participating parties usually take the method of reducing the quality of the project, which cannot meet the functional requirements or have potential safety hazards during the operation of the project. The accuracy of the project cost at this stage is usually low using the traditional ration method glutamate. With the continuous change of meteorology and the increasingly complex composition of water conservancy, the water conservancy scheduling problem model presents high-dimensional and complex characteristics, and it seems to be a multi-objective optimization problem. The investment funds for water conservancy project construction have been greatly increased, and the actual funds consumed are far greater than the project budget. Because the construction unit cannot bear the non-budgetary financial burden of the project, it directly enters a stagnant state or greatly reduces the progress of the project. Often due to the complexity of the problem, within an acceptable time or space range. From the characteristics of water project cost management, the main reasons are that such projects have long been using non-standardized design, the funds have not been in place in time, and the advanced and targeted means of cost estimation are insufficient. Under the influence of these factors, the water project cost is distorted for a long time. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimal solution, and it is introduced into the field of quality control of core processes of water engineering materials. © 2023 IEEE."

This requires changes in the development and organization of software development. This study introduced a quantitative software development management methodology that estimates the relative importance and risk of functionality retention or abundance, which determines the final value of the software product. The final value of a software product is interpreted as a function of its requirements and functionalities, represented as a computational graph (called a software product graph). The software product graph allows the relative importance of functionalities to be estimated by calculating the corresponding partial derivatives of the value function. The risk of not implementing functionality was estimated by reducing the product's final value. This model was applied to two EU projects, CareHD and vINCI. In vINCI, functionalities with the most significant added value to the application are developed based on the implemented model, and those related to the least value are abandoned. Optimization was not implemented in the CareHD project, and proceeded as initially designed. Consequently, only 71% of the CareHD potential value was achieved. The proposed model enables rational management and organization of software product development with real-time quantitative evaluation of functionalities impacts and, assessment of the risks of omitting them without a significant impact. Quantitative evaluation of the impacts and risks of retention or abundance is possible based on the proposed algorithm, which is the core of the model.

Although these buildings are characterized by different geometrical and material configurations, all of them have load-bearing façade walls made of adobe. This paper illustrates an analysis of the seismic vulnerability of these adobe façade walls according to different geometrical configurations and considering an out-of-plane loading. This study is based on original in-situ collected data about 45 one and multi-storey buildings. The seismic behaviour of the case studies is investigated through a demand versus capacity analysis based on 5 different failure mechanisms and considering a variable intensity of the seismic action. This procedure has allowed to classify the case studies according to their seismic vulnerability and to identify the most relevant failure mechanisms in such adobe façades.

This method mainly introduces Particle swarm optimization algorithm into the process of project cost evaluation to optimize the parameters and weight distribution of the evaluation model, so as to improve the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results. The main feature of this method is its dynamism, as it can adjust the evaluation model in real-time according to different engineering changes to achieve more accurate dynamic cost estimation. Therefore, this method can better cope with the complexity and variability of engineering construction. The specific realization of this method is to introduce the Particle swarm optimization algorithm, set the optimization model according to the estimation goal and range, and calculate and adjust the optimization goal of each parameter as the objective function. This method can be solved through multiple iterations to obtain the optimal solution, thereby achieving accurate calculation of dynamic estimation of engineering costs. In a word, the dynamic estimation method of project cost based on Particle swarm optimization algorithm can provide more accurate cost estimation results of buildings and related projects, and solve the problem that there is a large deviation between the accuracy of cost estimation and the actual cost in the industry.

This is in view of the vastness and topographical alignment of Nigeria's landmass, which makes it a country of extreme climatic variability from north to south. As construction costs in Nigeria, similarly, tend to show a north-south alignment, the study's objective is to establish cost-estimating relationships (CERs) between the variability of climatic elements and the variance in construction cost, to arouse interest in the concept. Design/methodology/approach: Deploying correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, significant associations/relationships between meteorological variables and building cost for selected locations, following a North-South transect of the major climatic zones, are sought, to explain climate-induced construction cost variance. Validation of the regression model was carried out using variance analysis and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error of a different dataset. Findings: Climatic indices of atmospheric moisture exhibited strong direct and partial correlations with construction costs, while sunshine hours and temperature were inversely correlated. The study further establishes statistically significant CERs between climatic variables and building cost in Nigeria, which accounted for 47.9% of the variance in construction cost across the climatic zones. Practical implications: The study outcome provides a statistically valid platform for the development of more elaborate analytical costing models, for prototype buildings to be cited in disparate climatic settings. Originality/value: This study establishes the statistical validity of climatic variables in constituting CERs for predicting construction costs in disparate climatic settings. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Accordingly, a rough construction cost estimation module was developed and applied to 25 new pumping stations in Korea.

The lack of data on renewable energy resources can lead to errors in the estimation of energy production in the first tens of percent, while capital and operating costs are often underestimated by multifold.

To improve the accuracy of early-stage cost estimation for construction projects, an improved neural network prediction model was proposed based on BP (back propagation) neural network and Snake Optimizer algorithm (SO). SO algorithm is adopted to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the BP neural network. Cost data for 50 construction projects undertaken by Shandong Tianqi Real Estate Group in China was collected, and the data samples were clustered into three categories using cluster analysis. 18 engineering feature indicators were determined through a literature review and 10 feature indicators were selected using Boruta algorithm for the input set. Compared to BP neural network and PSO–BP neural network, the results show that the improved SO–BP model has higher prediction accuracy, stability, better generalization ability and applicability. Therefore, based on reasonable feature indicators, the method proposed in this paper has certain guiding significance for predicting engineering costs. © 2023. Hao Cui, Junjie Xia."

Moreover, government initiatives to promote ambitious national plans for the renovation and construction of new school buildings are gaining vast attention. For this purpose, the Ministry of Education, with the local authorities’ collaboration, carries out a database to register national school buildings and their level of consistency and functionality, which is the fundamental knowledge tool for planning interventions in the sector. However, it does not provide a guideline to estimate future interventions’ costs. This research aims to design a retrofitting cost estimation model for energy and seismic improvement and adaptation interventions using Artificial Neural Networks. It can serve as a beneficial tool for forecasting expenses based on the interrelated building features, which the public administration can use to optimize the management and planning of school buildings’ funds. The proposed work focuses on a small sample of over 200 school buildings and their seismic and energy retrofitting costs. The ANN model uses the parameters of the case studies as the input to train the network to estimate the retrofitting cost of other projects based on the historical data. The parameters are categorized into three groups of features: (i) building's characteristics, e.g., construction year and the number of floors, (ii) energy retrofit parameters, e.g., class heating energy consumption, and (iii) seismic retrofit parameters, e.g., seismic zone and structural type. Therefore, the goal is to facilitate the financial feasibility assessments and optimize the available resources related to the planning of interventions. The proposed model will contribute significantly to school buildings’ resilience as a single integrated space, which has the characteristics of habitability, flexibility, functionality, comfort, and well-being. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Though standards, requirements, and development control rules (DCR) govern the construction project lifecycle, only a few applications have been developed to investigate BIM’s capability in automated code compliance checking (ACCC). A significant amount of the existing application limits its checking capabilities to direct parameter values, easily extractable from a Building Information Model (BIM). On the other hand, a few clauses require implicit information to be extensively expressed in machine language for automated checking. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) derived from BIM models lacks the relational connections of building elements required for extracting property values for automated checking. This study develops a model to restructure a topologically complex element relationship (i.e., sunshade projection width) in an IFC schema. Different categories of semantic enrichment tasks are performed for restructuring and to represent the required clause test values explicitly. The model’s performance was assessed on a test case concerning the clause requirements of the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR) code for Maharashtra, India. The compliance check method identified the sunshades in the developed model through simple if-then conditions. The method adopted in the study can be applied to similar code requirements to reduce the manual data preprocessing effort required from the architects and modelers, leading to enhanced penetration of ACCC in the industry. © ISARC 2023.

Moreover, the enormous increase in face masks and face shields caused by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has doubled the generated plastic wastes. Although there is an added benefit of using plastic waste in construction, the cost associated with their application, specifically the face mask, has not been addressed. This paper presents a simplified and rapid estimation of the cost associated with the collection, processing, and application of face masks in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. Two scenarios, mask modified asphalt pavement and conventional asphalt pavement, are considered. The total cost is based on market price and prices from waste management facilities and plastic processing companies. Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) is used to evaluate the long-term costs of mask modified asphalt pavement and conventional asphalt pavement. Results show that no significant difference in initial total cost between the two scenarios for pavement sections with lengths less than 500m and the number of lanes less than 6. The difference in total cost begins with lengths greater than 500 m for 5 and 6 Lanes. Despite the higher initial costs for the mask modified asphalt pavement, the LCCA shows that there is a 29% maintenance cost reduction over the 40 years life cycle of the asphalt pavement. The use of LCCA shows the benefit of the selection of the most cost-effective strategy and how the use of mask modified asphalt pavement over the conventional asphalt pavement can save money over the life cycle of the asphalt and improve rutting and stiffens. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Thus, the study of the application of relational databases through SQL with a different approach, namely integrating project tables such as resource tables, cost items, work items, and project drawings, which are currently being worked on separately. As the output, it would be demonstrated into a supply chain management table (table_3), construction cash flow (table_4), and the quantity take-off management table (table_5). The total project price from the result of the SQL program shown in supply chain and project cash flow tables is IDR 1.42 billion, with a project duration of 109 days. The SCM table describes the types of resources used in the project, including the quantity and price values. Then, the table of CSF contains a list of cost items and the volume and price of work for the budget plan and cash flow plan. Moreover, the QTO table describes the association between cost items and project drawings intended to project surveyors for the quantity take-off management process. Project managers are always required to make decisions for project control appropriately, such as cost estimation, resource planning, and project schedule effectively. Therefore, through those three tables, the authors hope they can help construction practitioners to improve their construction projects efficiently in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

It allows for accurate cost estimation, material procurement, scheduling, and quality control. The system also provides real-time monitoring of project progress and helps identify potential issues before they become significant. The application of BIM technology in the construction of prefabricated building has also strengthened the cooperation between different stakeholders in the project.

Among the leading explanations for cost overrun (CO), factors accounting for large variances in actual cost are shown to have psychological or political roots. The context of public sector social housing projects (PSSHPs) in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is positioned with similar CO challenges. This study is the fifth phase of a series of research projects on the vulnerability of PSSHPs to COs, and the need to de-risk cost estimates. The aim of this study is to present a simple and practical application of Reference Class Forecasting (RCF), a promising solution utilizing an “outside view” approach, as an effective control to reduce the variance of forecasted cost inaccuracies. Using a sample set of 82 housing projects, a reference class of 23 projects was selected based on properties such as design-build procurement type and local contractor involvement. A probability distribution was then established for this reference class, and required cost uplifts to be applied were based on the level of risk a housing agency is willing to accept for PSSHPs. Finally, the accuracy of the reference class was tested using a recently completed project. The results showed that the RCF method, based on a 50th percentile risk acceptance of CO, provides a closer estimate to the actual costs of the project as compared to the contracted costs. This empirical study is the first to undertake and implement RCF in the 52 SIDS and presents the first instance of practical RCF in public housing projects worldwide, thus providing a platform for improvement in future PSSHPs’ budget forecasting. The research can be applied to lessen societal and economic welfare losses as well as significant financial risks for governments. The implementation of practical safeguards, such as RCF, together with contemporary standard project controls, provides immediate advantages for enhancing accuracy in present forecasting approaches against financial risks. It allows for improved value derived from social infrastructure projects, improved supply of public housing, and consequently progress for these nations towards achieving their sustainable development goals. © 2023 by the authors."

A large part of the literature on urban land valuation uses the land residual method, which relies on the assumption that structures are easily replaced. But urban land value depends on accessibility to nearby land uses, implying that infrastructure and the slowly changing built environment are the most important components of land value. Investments in structures are only slowly reversible, implying that land and structure function as a bundled good whereas land residual theory severs the connection between land value and structure value over time. We develop a simple theoretical model that includes option value and compare to a nested land residual model before and after a shock to values. Cross-sectionally our model shows that land residual theory overestimates structure value. Over time almost all of any change in property value is allocated to land residuals. Data from Maricopa county, AZ, 2012–2018 strongly support option value models when nested within a general model that also includes land residuals. FHFA estimates use entirely different cost estimation methods: our analysis of FHA data suggest that our conclusions generalize to the U.S. as a whole, and that high and rising land value ratios over 50 years (the “hockey stick” pattern found in the literature) are likely an artifact of the residual model. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This was accomplished by carrying out a comprehensive literature review of the factors affecting cost deviation; implementing a survey questionnaire for project participants, including contractors, consultants, and clients, who are aware of the construction industry in Saudi Arabia; and developing a model for cost deviation based on the questionnaire data using the partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The cost deviation model was developed, and the PLS-SEM provided the critical factors affecting cost deviation and gave theoretical support for the study’s conceptual framework. The results revealed that the problem is shared by the owners and contractors, as the factors with the highest rankings were project characteristics, contractual procedures, and estimator performance.

We estimated the error rate of predicting construction costs through sub-construction cost prediction to be 16.80%, a level similar to that of the total construction cost prediction error rate of 17.67%. This study shows that the construction cost can be calculated by predicting detailed cost factors at once, and it is expected that various types of construction costs or partial construction costs can be predicted using the predicted detailed cost elements. As a result of predicting several sub-construction costs using multioutput-based ANN, it was found that the prediction error rate varies depending on the type of construction. To improve accuracy, it is necessary to supplement influencing factors suitable for the construction features. © 2022 by the author."

Reliable forecasts provide insight into the movements of labor costs and are critical to the success of projects. Past studies have primarily focused on forecasting construction cost indexes or material costs. Only a few studies have concentrated on forecasting construction labor costs. This study presents a multivariate Bayesian structural time series (MBSTS) model to characterize the future values of construction labor's average hourly earnings (AHE) using a set of candidate predictors. The methodologies commonly used by past studies do not adequately address the uncertainties associated with the modeling process. In contrast, MBSTS recognizes the uncertainty in its modeling process, which enables practitioners to quantify and account for future labor cost risks in decisions. Furthermore, the MBSTS method results in a transparent model, helping analysts investigate the rationality of the parameters. This article trains MBSTS models under four different data subset lengths (i.e., 150, 144, 138, and 132 months) to study the consistency of the explanatory variables and their corresponding coefficients. The analysis results indicate that the gross domestic product (GDP), housing starts (HS), number of building permits (BP), Construction Cost Index (CCI), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), and Standard and Poor's 500 index (SPI) are the most frequently used predictors in the regression component of the MBSTS models. The results indicate an inverse relationship between AHE from one side and HS and BP from the other. Likewise, a direct relationship exists between AHE and GDP, CCI, DJI, and SPI. The MBSTS model performed well on the validation subset in the midrange prediction intervals (i.e., 12- and 18-month periods). However, it was outperformed by conventional time series models [i.e., seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)] when used for short-term forecasting. The proposed framework can be applied to facilitate monetary resource allocation in projects.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Since the beginning of mankind, people strived for perfection when it came to their creations, products, gains, or self-improvement. Extension of activities and their cost, time, and resource limitations have caused researchers to pay their attention to optimizing the activities in construction management engineering. Rapid development in optimization techniques to solve related problems in structural design can be achieved accordingly. In this paper, meta-heuristic algorithms used for strength, energy, and cost optimization of building material in construction management. The novel meta-heuristic algorithm can be used for electricity cost and peak load alleviation with the minimum user waiting time. The proposed model is implemented in a smart building in terms of electricity cost estimation for both a single smart home and a smart building. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme for single and multiple smart homes in terms of strength, energy, and cost optimization of building material in construction management engineering. This study has used the artificial intelligence (AI) model as particle swarm optimization (PSO) model to calculate the accurate and material-specific energy of three commonly used building materials as fly ash, copper slag, and phospo-gypsum. Two regression models as root mean square (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to calculate the results. Following the results of (R2) and RMSE, PSO has shown its higher performance in predicting the strength, energy, and cost of building materials besides revealing a significant and positive correlation among them. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

In addition, the conservation method is complex, and quantity surveyors often find it difficult to source the required materials that may not be available. In Malaysia, although heritage buildings conservation is progressing cost information and relevant documents required for conservation are still lacking. Hence, jeopardising the accuracy of cost estimation of heritage building conservation in Malaysia. Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM) technology has become a solution to the traditional approach of building conservation practice with its capability to integrate the 3D terrestrial laser scanners. Past studies on HBIM and the use of 3D laser scanners focused on the construction of the as-built Building Information Modelling (BIM) model. However, quantity surveyors' ability to perform their professional practices on the HBIM platform and the use of 3D laser scanners for heritage building conservation is less explored. Thus, this paper provides the basis for the research approach that will be used to achieve the study's goal; (1) 3D data collecting, (2) data processing, (3) as-built BIM production, and (4) quantity take-off are the four primary phases of the technique.

By combining a ranked risk magnitude index and an assigned risk zone, fifteen major risks were identified and assessed. Companies are advised to use the list to develop a resourceful general risk plan. Combining the two methods together makes the risk plan more representative and thus more reliable, as the two proposed methods can result in different rankings. The top fifteen risks in the Syrian construction industry were mainly management, financial and design risks. Locating in the zone of maximum risk came “an unprecedented increase in raw-material prices” and “the loss due to an increase in fuel prices” as number one and number two, respectively”. “Unavailability of resources” was next in the zone of high risk. “Improper cost estimation” and “losing critical work forces at a critical time” scored high in the final ranking. © 2023, Jordan University of Science and Technology.

Given the energy intensive nature of processing aluminum, China faces enormous pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The trends of GHG emissions from aluminum production in China from 2021 to 2060 were obtained by building a technologic roadmap and multifactor analysis model containing the factors of energy structure, technology improvement, and product structure under 9 scenarios. Based on the cost estimation model, the cost of technology application was calculated. Meanwhile, the variation in the drivers of energy-related GHG emissions over time for different scenarios was identified by adopting the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) approach. The results indicated that the GHG emissions of 1 t aluminum production cycle showed a decreasing trend for all 9 scenarios but could not be completely eliminated; hence, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology should be considered for integration into the production system to achieve zero emissions.

With a DfMA approach, cost estimation requires taking product design and production processes into consideration. Current studies conduct cost estimation built upon quantity takeoffs. However, they do not provide a vocabulary to relate cost estimates to offsite construction processes. This paper presents a new domain ontology, Offsite Housing Ontology (OHO) using the NeOn methodology framework to support cost estimation considering products, resources, and production processes. OHO semantically defines offsite construction domain terminology and relationships. This supports a unified model, required for efficient collaborative design management. The efficiency and effectiveness of the OHO approach are demonstrated in a real-world DfMA scenario through the development of a Knowledge-Based Engineering tool to automate cost estimation. The approach can be adapted and extended to accommodate a very wide range of offsite housing, delivering important optimization and automation benefit from DfMA solutions.

Small modular reactors are proposed as a remedy. Smaller reactors will require one fourth to one third the person-hours of labor and leverage more common supply chains, putting less strain on each step of the construction process. This study presents a methodology for estimating the construction duration of nuclear projects, so the sensitivity of proposed concepts to staffing and labor constraints can be analyzed. The methodology builds on a previous overnight capital cost estimation tool and builds a Gantt chart out of 226 tasks. The genetic algorithm assigns resources to each task to minimize construction time subject to peak staffing and hiring rate constraints. The results were consistently within 15% of seven benchmark durations. Under tighter labor constraints, the construction duration of large reactors increased 42% on average and only 3% for small reactors. Modularization of systems and structures reduced construction durations 60%, but it increased the sensitivity to labor constraints. Small reactors were more sensitive to the modularization assumptions because of the compact structures and layout, and the power specific cost ($/kW) sensitivity was higher, but the total financial impact was smaller because the total costs were lower. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

The detailed economic assessment was done by applying an integrated methodology for the economic assessment to reduce the existing gap between the capital expenditures estimated from conceptual design and detailed engineering. The integrated economic assessment approach was developed involving conceptual and detailed design aspects. For this purpose, the PLA production process was evaluated using the glucose platform from sugarcane bagasse, coffee cut stems, and plantain peels as raw materials. The yield of glucose, operating and investment costs were considered from the open literature. The mass and energy balances for the process were obtained using Aspen Plus V.9.0. software. The capital cost estimation (CapEx) was made using the Aspen Capital Cost Estimator. CapEx and operational expenditures (OpEx) estimates were adjusted using industry guidelines. Finally, financial analysis methods and key ratios were used to measure the investment profitability and prefeasibility of the process at various PLA gross incomes. Regarding the methodology proposed, a comparison between the traditional economic assessment and the proposed integrated strategy showed a deviation of 256%. The results are more similar than those reported by the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies. Finally, the CapEx for the PLA process with an annual production rate of 2000 MT reached up to USD 10.35 million with a gross income of USD 1400/MT and 9.5 years payback period from containing economic prefeasibility.

Nonetheless, there are serious shortcomings in BIM design that are inherent to project management, such as the preparation of a building execution technology project, the process of existing standards and collecting information in the building's exploitation period, and analysis of the existing situation and preparation of a building investment project. Knowledge and building information modeling technologies provide several roles and chances for achieving project objectives in a more efficient and effective manner, influencing the construction project management process.

In particular, execution risks and associated defect costs have risen recently. Deadlines, cost pressure, growing process, and material complexity justify these cost increases. Therefore, achieving a balance between the optimum level of quality and the associated costs requires knowledge of the composition of quality-related costs. Despite steadily increasing amounts of quality data from digital building models, sensors, and standards, calculation models in the construction industry predicting appraisal costs remain non-existent. Therefore, this paper aims to determine expected appraisal costs from building information modeling (BIM) objects via automated semantic web technologies. The ontology for construction quality assurance (OCQA), which is used for the automatic planning of quality inspections, serves as the initial ontology in this paper. The expected quality-related appraisal costs are determined automatically via Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) rules based on the OCQA, BIM data, and historical quality data. The inferred appraisal costs are stored in the OCQA extension ontology for construction quality assurance appraisal cost (OCQA-AC). To demonstrate the rules’ functionality, leveling methods and associated defect-type unevenness are used as examples. © 2023, European Council on Computing in Construction (EC3).

However, due to high investment and operating costs, it is not easy to transport hydrogen by pipelines. At this stage, a techno-economic model can carry out pre-feasibility and feasibility assessment on each stage of the pipeline, and describe the technical content and characteristics of the pipeline. For hydrogen pipeline, the existing domestic and foreign research on hydrogen pipeline generally regards the hydrogen pipeline as a transportation mode of the transportation link in the hydrogen supply chain process for macro supply chain system optimization, but cannot reflect the detailed technical characteristics and market changes of the pipeline. This has led to significant changes in the cost of hydrogen pipelines. Aming at this issue, this paper combines with the technical characteristics of existing pipelines and cost analysis method to develop a technical-economic model, analyzes the relationship between the main composition cost of hydrogen pipeline, the levelized cost of hydrogen pipeline and the transportation scale, and uses the levelized cost of hydrogen as the analysis index to compare the transportation mode of hydrogen pipeline with that of long-pipe trailer, natural gas hydrogen blending pipeline and liquid hydrogen tank car. Finally, the investment and construction cost range and levelized cost range of domestic hydrogen pipeline will be obtained. In addition, this paper proposes the main ways to reduce the transportation cost of hydrogen pipeline, mainly including increasing the scale of hydrogen transportation, reforming the existing oil and gas pipeline and optimizing the transportation mode layout including hydrogen pipeline. The research results show that: ① When the design throughput is the demand in 2040, the operation result of the hydrogen pipeline is to select the DN500 hydrogen pipeline for transportation, and the pressure of the stations along the line meets the requirements and the flow rate of the pipeline is within the safe range. ② Given the design capacity, the total construction investment range is 9.66×108~35.43×108 CNY for 150~155 km pipelines. ③ The levelized transportation cost of hydrogen pipeline increases with the increase of transportation distance but is no more than 10.12 CNY/kg when the transportation scale is constant. ④Compared with long tube trailers and liquid hydrogen tankers, the cost of hydrogen pipeline transportation has price advantage under given transportation scale and different transportation distance, and the price range is 2.76 ~10.12 CNY/kg. The research results can provide the basis for the cost estimation of pure hydrogen pipeline, have important significance for the reasonable selection of hydrogen pipeline project investment and economic benefit evaluation and comparative analysis, and provide reference for pipeline construction. © 2023, Tsinghua University Press.

In this study, conceptual designs of hydrate-based dual functional plant (desalination and salt production) utilizing the eutectic crystallization of hydrate and NaCl dihydrate have been presented on an industrial scale with the capacity of 24 m3/day. The conceptual design proposed in this study focuses on detailed and executive aspects, including the size of individual reactors, the selection of pumps, and the setting of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The process designs help meet these present demands on hydrate-based desalination and conform to the global standards of minimizing energy requirement and the disposal of environmental pollutants. Hydrate-based plant was designed as a novel Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) process to produce potable water and salt simultaneously, with the recovery ratio of pure water from seawater achieving 95%. The design-based cost estimation showed that the annual operating cost is estimated US$2.29/m3 for cyclopentane-hydrate-based plant and US$3.64/m3 for CO2-hydrate-based plant. The results suggest that the hydrate-based plants will bring gross profit comparable to the reported ZLD plants; that is, the gross profit will achieve US$20 per 1 m3 of water production. In addition to these two improvements over the existing plants, the hydrate-based process designs also exhibit favorable energy requirement compared to the eutectic system of ice.

The framework is novel due the fact that it integrates the non-linear complexities and challenges induced by the chemical plant and power system constraints. The work also considers spatiotemporal and quantitative distributions of water sources, water withdrawal, and consumption rates of involved power and chemical technologies. Furthermore, the framework incorporates land resource characteristics, including geological surface features and elevation changes, and devises a strategy for practical cost estimation of different gas transmission expansion stages. Compared to conventional expansion approaches, which disregard complications of chemical plants and resource dependencies, the proposed framework provides a realistic view. Firstly, the study captures the expansion impacts of chemical plants and tackles the research challenge of prioritizing expansion planning alternatives in which natural gas can be supplied as the fuel of power plants to meet power demands, or it can be fed as the feedstock of new chemical plants to create added values. Secondly, the framework considers water resource limitations and characteristics and evaluates impacts of water usage policies on the integrated systems.

It enables better engineering decisions and suitable selection of the appropriate treatment scheme based on parametric criteria, requirement of space, construction cost and annual cost of operation as well as maintenance. The literatures available in the context of selection of appropriate technology for biological treatment of wastewater on the basis of engineering economics and other issues are limited, and in most of the studies, the cost functions for wastewater treatment plants have been derived from region-specific historic cost data collected. The objective of this paper is to highlight the importance of initiatives to develop the cost functions and present a methodology for its development by the application of modelled algorithms for process design as well as cost estimation and the use of different statistical regression techniques.

This project is a collaboration with civil engineering and informatics to make an application using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Many times the project manager gets bids from many contractors to complete a single project. Cost estimation is a determinant element and becomes a guide to formulating policies that can be taken primarily in determining the number of investment costs or the budget that must be allocated annually and can be made the best suggestion to the project manager which contractor can provide the greatest benefit to the project manager. There are several studies that have developed applications for cost estimation, and some have even involved experts to validate the output of the application. However, this study combines five studies as FAHP calculations and two experts to assess the results of the application. FAHP in this research has five criteria, there are drainage, earthworks, grained pavement and cement pavement, paved pavement, and structure. The FAHP method can be implemented in selecting the best project that can provide the lowest raw material purchase price and give the best profit to the project manager, which can be shown by the Application FAHP with the lowest Total Score value. This process is carried out by the admin doing pairwise comparisons with the AHP scale, transforming the pairwise comparison matrix into the TFN scale, calculating the fuzzy synthesis value (Si), the vector value (V), and the defuzzification ordinate (d'), input the project budget that has been implemented (or last year), normalization, calculating the consistency ratio and calculating the best cost estimation as a total score FAHP.  © 2022 The Authors."

While vertical construction project characteristics are more specific, to identify the project characteristics of vertical construction and their influence on vertical construction projects, mixed method data analysis comprising science mapping and thematic analysis has been followed. The literature was searched in Scopus and made 43 articles to review, followed by a bibliometric search strategy. The keywords used for searching are “project characteristic*”, “project attribute*”, “construction” and “building*”. After an extensive literature review, different types of vertical construction projects were identified, and 21 characteristics affect the decision-making on any vertical construction. The results implied that the project characteristics are the key players in any decision-making process, delivery methods selection, risk management, disputes, cost estimation, reworks and delays.

Methods that enable quick and reasonably accurate conceptual cost estimates are crucial for achieving successful decisions in the early stages of construction projects. For this reason, numerous machine learning methods proposed in the literature that use different learning mechanisms. In recent years, the case-based reasoning (CBR) method has received particular attention in the literature for conceptual cost estimation of construction projects that use similarity-based learning principles. Despite the fact that CBR provides a powerful and practical alternative for conceptual cost estimation, one of the main criticisms about CBR is its low prediction performance when there is not a sufficient number of cases. This paper presents a bootstrap aggregated CBR method for achieving advancement in CBR research, particularly for conceptual cost estimation of construction projects when a limited number of training cases are available. The proposed learning method is designed so that CBR can learn from a diverse set of training data even when there are not a sufficient number of cases. The performance of the proposed bootstrap aggregated CBR method is evaluated using three data sets. The results revealed that the prediction performance of the new bootstrap aggregated CBR method is better than the prediction performance of the existing CBR method. Since the majority of conceptual cost estimates are made with a limited number of cases, the proposed method provides a contribution to CBR research and practice by improving the existing methods for conceptual cost estimating. © 2023 by the authors."

The situation is more complex in multi-stage bidding (MSG) where general contractors must deal with the complexity of accounting for the bids of their subcontractors and face a greater threat of falling prey to the winner’s curse (i.e. situation where the winning contractor underestimates the actual cost of the project). Existing research efforts have tackled the issue of the winner’s curse in MSG from the general contractor’s perspective. However, there is a lack of research in developing bidding models that simultaneously aid both general contractors and subcontractors in determining their bid value to mitigate the winner’s curse in MSG. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors utilized an interdependent game theory (GT) and reinforcement learning (RL) approach, that includes: formulation of MSG framework; incorporation of two RL algorithms, namely the multiplicative weights and the modified Roth-Erev, to be utilized by subcontractors in preparation of their bids; utilization of MSG game-theoretic bid function for the preparation of the general contractors’ bids for the whole project; development of the MSG-GTRL model; and testing the MSG-GTRL model through simulating various bidding scenarios using a combination of actual and synthetic dataset of infrastructure projects. Results show that integrating GT and RL in MSG bidding enables general contractors and their subcontractors to simultaneously improve their financial state by minimizing the occurrence of negative earnings, and thus, avoiding the winner’s curse in their respective portions of projects. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Liulin County was selected as the study area. This paper creatively divided non-geological disaster sampling areas by macro-geomorphology, and carried out susceptibility mapping based on random forest (RF) and frequency ratio-random forest (FR-RF) models. The accuracy of each model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) combined with the distribution characteristics of geological disasters and the actual urban construction in the study area. The results show that the FR-RF model constructed by selecting non-geological disaster samples in hilly area is most suitable for the susceptibility mapping of this study area. The different results in different sampling areas are mainly due to the great changes in the representativeness of non-geological disaster samples. The distance from the roads is the most important factor affecting the occurrence of disasters in the study area. The statistical results of disaster management cost estimation and gross domestic product (GDP) value show that the disaster management cost of HFR-RF model decreases by 13.45% on average compared with other models, and the ratio of GDP to disaster management cost is relatively high.

One of the most important characteristics of this industry is its fragmentation and the fact that the different actors involved in construction projects come from different organizations and have to work together on a temporary basis to achieve a common goal. Therefore, to improve productivity and collaboration, the use of information technology is inevitable and has long been seen as a potential solution to the issue. In this context, numerous research studies have addressed the potential of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve collaboration and productivity in the industry. BIM has many benefits such as increased constructability, reduced conflicts, and reduced cost estimation times, as well as many other opportunities. However, there are many challenges associated with adopting this approach within the construction industry, and the adoption rates appear to be lower than expected. Not all BIM users have all the knowledge needed to take full advantage of the potential of this approach, whether it be for communication between project teams, the use and visualization of the model, or the dissemination of information between different trades. There is also a lack of client commitment to BIM in the industry, but also a targeted deployment of BIM in a few uses by a limited number of construction industry stakeholders. To overcome these challenges, it is necessary to propose more integrative BIM solutions, with ease of understanding and capable of accommodating different profiles and backgrounds. In this context, to facilitate the deployment and application of BIM, easily accessible technologies such as immersive systems and interfaces could be a promising alternative. Thus, Virtual Reality (VR) is emerging as a promising asset to the BIM approach. However, very few research works have been dedicated to the interoperability between BIM and VR environments. This research project aims to propose a VR-based intuitive visualization and interaction environment, allowing involving the project owners and the public in the choice of project options. The paper first presents the different steps and methods that allowed the design of a virtual tour model using Unreal Engine.

The goal of this study was to determine if prefabricated and timber frame building methods and materials have the potential to replace traditional method of construction in the context of cost and time. For this purpose, a qualitative analysis was performed, including a list of benefits of each of the analysed construction technologies and a quantitative analysis in which the cost of finished houses per 1 m2 of usable area was compared. The analyses were conducted for two single-family houses with similar characteristics using scheduling and cost estimation software. The conducted analyses have shown that the shortest time to build a house is in the prefabricated reinforced concrete technology. The used construction technology from ready-made prefabricated elements affects the time of building house and thus, the costs of its construction. The construction time for the house in case of a timber frame structure and made of ready-made reinforced concrete prefabricated elements is similar but the cost of a timber frame structure is much higher. It takes longest time to build a house in traditional brick technology and requires the involvement of the largest financial resources from all three analysed construction technologies. Despite this, traditional brick technology is the most used in construction in Poland and other Central and Easter Europe countries. This is due to the widespread belief of investors about the durability of a building made in this technology and the habits of investors resulting from a long-standing tradition of construction. However, the study's results in the world showed that a change in build technology is a step in addressing the concerns of poor quality and reduce construction costs and time, increasing the construction sector's productivity and sustainability.  © 2023.

There are several factors that could result in cost or schedule overruns ranging from unplanned non-productive time, inefficiencies, changes in macro indices etcetera; however, one often overlooked factor is deficient time and cost estimation. Hence in addition to factoring prevailing market and contract rates for materials and services, it is important to critically analyze and benchmark plans against known performance for higher accuracy around estimations. Well project time and cost models generally consist of estimating in modules or sub-phases and aggregating these modules to makeup the total. This can either result in a single discrete estimate or in ranges based on probability and statistical performance - inherently implying that some form of historic performance is crucial to the estimation accuracy. This paper describes a structured approach to developing a probabilistic estimation tool by analyzing past performance data at a phase or subphase level. This tool can be domiciled on a range of computation platforms using similar methodology, which comprises data collection from execution reports, data cleanup and organization to harmonize terminologies and group operation types, and finally statistical and mathematical data analysis. Statistical analysis develops probabilistic relationships in the dataset and correlation between performance variables such as depth and time; while mathematical analysis incorporates numerical correlations and multiple variables to generate estimates in modules and finally aggregates the discrete phase estimates. The estimation has two major components - Time and Cost. • The analysis of time component considers the productive and non-productive time by phase; determines depth dependent operations and their correlation to time and assigns a mathematical function to each phase • The cost component is broken down into two sub-components - recurrent cost which is highly time-dependent and non-recurrent (material and services) cost which are usually based on predefined contractual rates • An additional end function is benchmarking, for comparison between estimates and historic performance The aggregate of the probabilistic estimate of each module gives the total estimate of time and cost for a given well construction or intervention scope, with the overall objective of improving and maintaining estimation accuracy to avoid overruns and over-estimation of drilling, completions, workover and intervention projects.

The discussion has three main implications: (a) predictive analytics for cost estimation have not followed the best practices and standard methodologies; (b) predictive analytics techniques are ready for industry adoption; and (c) the study can be a reference for high-level decision-makers to implement predictive analytics in cost estimation. Knowledge of predictive analytics could assist stakeholders in playing a key role in improving the accuracy of cost forecast in the construction market, thus, enabling pro-active management of the project owner’s budget. © 2022 by the authors."

Penetration rate (PR) and machine utilization (U) are the two principal measures of TBM performance for evaluating the feasibility of using a machine in a given ground condition. However, despite the widespread use of TBMs and established track records, accurate estimation of machine performance could still be a challenge, particularly in complex geological conditions. Since different types of rocks have varied texture (cementation and grain size), and respond differently to cutting forces in the TBM tunnelling, incorporating the effects of rock type in performance prediction models can improve the accuracy of the estimates. The aim of this study was to develop models for predicting penetration rate of hard rock TBMs in different types of rock based on field penetration index (FPI), using multivariable regression analysis and machine learning algorithm, including classification and regression tree (CART). The proposed models offer estimated FPIs in different rock types, rock strength, and rock mass properties in the form of graphs (diagrams), which can be used to estimate TBM penetration rate. The proposed models have been developed based on the analysis of a comprehensive database of TBM performance in various rock types and offers more accurate estimates of machine performance by incorporating many of the key parameters available in typical geotechnical reports and contract documents. The models also exhibit sensitivity to rock mass parameters for predicting the penetration rate. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Yet, the two main services provided by design firms, namely ‘designing the project’, and ‘supervision of construction operations’ labelled as engineering services, despite their comparatively low cost, can significantly affect the total cost of construction projects as they can engender reworks, changes and disputes on project participants during the subsequent stages of the project. Continuous evaluation of engineering services' cost overruns (ESCO) is quintessentially important in order to prevent consequential problems later on in the project's development and use. Consequently, this research proposes a robust random forest (RF) regression model to predict ESCOs considering both project-related and organizational-related variables. A database consisting of 95 high-rise residential building projects designed during the past eight years in Iran, along with 12 related variables, were collected to develop and validate the model. The results were also compared with those of support vector regression (SVR) and multiple linear regression (MLR), which indicated that with an R2 value of 0.8680 and mean-absolute-error (MAE) of 3.88, the RF regression model performs better than those baseline models, namely SVR and MLR. This research presents two main contributions to the existing body of knowledge. From the practical point of view, it provides an efficient tool for design firms enabling them to screen and prioritize their projects from the cost overrun standpoint and to devise a contingency plan for them. From the theoretical point of view, it revealed that to mitigate ESCOs, three key factors should be given thorough consideration, namely: ‘the level of computer-aided design technologies adoption’; ‘level of communication among the project team’; and scope definition adequacy’ – cumulatively, these three factors contribute to 52.35% of ESCO variations. © 2022"

Calculating the benefits and costs of adopting modularization precedes decision making. However, modular cost estimation is challenging since relevant information in the early stages of a project and historical data about industrial modularization both have limited availability. To solve this problem, this study developed a conceptual cost estimation framework for industrial modular projects by converting stick-built project information. The framework is composed of eight steps based on two approaches. This study conducted a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the framework, which compared the project cost of modularization scenarios 1 and 2 with that of the stick-built version of the ongoing project. In addition, the estimated modular cost was compared with the engineers’ estimation to verify the accuracy of the framework. The contributions of this study are in identifying and quantifying the factors influencing the differences in cost between the modularization and stick-built versions, and developing the conceptual cost estimation framework for an industrial modular project. This framework is expected to support deciding on adopting modularization, budgeting, and project viability. © 2022 The Author(s)."

To remain competitive in the market, it is crucial for companies to have an accurate estimate of their projects. Nevertheless, given that very little is known about the scope and details of the project, the conventional cost estimation methods tend to be slow and inaccurate. With the rise of computing power, there is now a tendency to use Machine Learning (ML)-based methods, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for more accurate cost estimation that can remain reliable in face of insufficient details during the tendering phase. While the use of ANN for cost estimation has been abundantly investigated from the perspective of contractors, there are very limited studies on the development and application of ML-based methods for engineering consultancy firms. Given that the nature of products/services offered by consultancy firms is inherently different from that of contractors (i.e. they are more abstract and less material-based) and also given that the type and level of detail of the available data at the tendering stage is dissimilar, it is important to investigate the applicability of ML-based methods for cost estimation in consultancy firms. To this end, this paper presents an artificial neural network approach for the cost estimation of engineering services. In developing the model, first, the influential factors that affect the costs of engineering services are identified. Thereafter, a model is developed using the data of 132 projects. Subsequently, a heuristic method is developed to systematically improve and fine-tune the performance of the model. Eventually, the findings show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can obtain a fairly accurate cost estimate, even with small datasets. In fact, the model proposed in this paper performed better than those proposed in other similar works. The model developed in this study showed a 14.5% improvement in the accuracy of the model, considering MAPE. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The cyclic behavior of Nibellen assembly was obtained, and the design equations were developed based on the available literature. Seismic performance of the system was then studied analytically. Two groups of buildings with different lateral force resisting systems were designed and studied: one group with the Nibellen system, and the other with the special concentrically braced frame system. Each building group consisted of 5-, 10-, and 15-story buildings. The Design-Base-Event (DBE) and Maximum Considered Event (MCE) were considered as the seismic hazard, and a suite of seven ground motions were scaled accordingly for response history analyses. Finally, the resiliency of the buildings was studied by obtaining the functionality curve of the buildings before and after the seismic event. The construction cost of the 5-story building with Nibellen bracing system increased but the post-earthquake cost decreased significantly. The application of Nibellen system in the 10- and 15-story buildings reduced both the construction and repair costs, considerably. Resiliency of all the buildings was improved when Nibellen system was used as the lateral force resisting system. Copyright © 2022 Techno-Press, Ltd."

The improvement of cost estimation performance is vital as it provides a better chance for the construction projects to avoid cost blowouts. In this paper, an extensive literature review is conducted fromonline databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar which focus on organization controls and its mechanisms to improve cost estimation performance in the construction industry. While many prior studies on cost estimation emphasized investigating cost estimation methods to improve the performance of cost estimation, less attention was given to organizational and project factors. Several studies have explored the effects of organizational control on performance but failed to include project complexity in the relationship between organizational controls and performance. Therefore, this paper conceptualizes the effect of organizational controls on cost estimation performance with project complexity as a moderator. This proposition suggests project complexity has advantages and disadvantages on organizational controls. Each control mechanism has its feature and effectiveness in high complexity projects. Hence, managers should select appropriate control mechanisms, such as input control and output control that have high effectiveness on the performance. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, in Korea, drones are mainly used for video shooting and pest control purposes, so the use of drones in the construction field is low. Several public construction corporations are currently using drones, but the application areas are mainly simple monitoring, such as status surveys, patrols, and exterior surveys. Therefore, in this study, the work guidelines of public construction corporations were reviewed and revised to enable the practical use of drone surveying and system preparation. Nine related work guidelines of Korea Land and Housing Corporation reviewed and derived a total of 26 revisions. After reviewing the relevant regulations of the National Geographic Information Institute and the construction standard estimating system of the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, revisions were derived if the work guidelines had no important contents or were different from the relevant regulations. In addition, revisions to increase the use of drones were suggested by finding cases where it is possible to use drones for the tasks in the guidelines. This study is expected to contribute to the objectification of drone flight and survey conditions, product quality control, cost estimation and payment, and increase of drone utilization by presenting directions for key improvements when improving construction-related guidelines for the use of drones. © 2022 AEPress, s.r.o..

When evaluating whether there is a statistically significant variation between claimed and computed labour outputs, student t-test and Pearson coefficient of correlation (r) are implied. With varying degrees, the outputs computed were consistently less than the claimed results (i.e., among 5 percent and 50 percent). Based on t-values, r, and p-values, the determination of the labour productivities showed to be statistically changed from the operator claims, with a level of significance taken as 5% and degree of freedom taken as 10. This emphasised the general conclusion that cost estimates and approaches supported guessing figures might be misleading. As a result of the study, we have identified methods for guessing and planning based on the number of gang hours for each work item, and have provided a useful starting point for learning additional subjects related to building projects and building types. This thus prompted the practitioners to discontinue using guess figures of labour output when doing things like estimating the value of a building project or designing its development programme. Furthermore, it recommended additional studies in which labour outputs of different construction operations and construction types are compared, instead of trying to match those activities. © 2021"

Early contractor involvement and target costing are key elements in collaborative delivery. This study explores how early contractor involvement and target cost has been implemented, and the effects of these elements, in the collaborative delivery of a building in Norway. After two months of daily observations and a literature study, further data was collected from the main stakeholders through a document study and sixteen semi-structured interviews. Establishing a reasonable scope, allowable cost and procurement strategy in the front-end was identified as important. Early contractor involvement was determined to have improved constructability, commitment, cost estimation, and team building during the design phase. A balanced, equitable and clear risk distribution in the target cost, and continuous involvement of the client and senior management, was identified as important for collaboration in the execution phase. External factors beyond the control of the project group were found to have been impactful throughout the project. The study calls for more research on the impact of external factors, and the involvement of architects, consultants and subcontractors, in Lean and collaborative project delivery. © 2022 30th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2022.

The strength of the construction lies with its ability to comply with standard digital design flows and that it provides a security parameter which directly links side-channel security metrics. A detailed leakage model is provided and investigated for the first time, and it is linked to electronic parameters of the randomization mechanism. We develop guidelines and optimization for concrete ASIC constructions, and sheds light on this ultra low-cost leakage-randomization mechanism. The proposed circuit is natural to be utilized without or on top of the popular masking countermeasures. It is demonstrated to be considerably more efficient in terms of attack data-complexity as compared to low-order masking (i.e., number of shares d=2). In addition, seemingly it is a nice and necessary fit to increase the noise when a too low-noise environment is expected, which impedes masking's theoretical security. Finally, it is discussed that the proposed mechanism is natural to be embedded with masked designs for higher security-levels (d> 2) while lowering significantly their asymptotically quadratic area price-tag as d increase. Robustness results are provided along with post place & route cost estimations for both AES encryption and a more recently proposed permutation such as ISAP. Our design efficiently provides unprecedented three orders-of-magnitude signal-to-noise reduction with a total area-overhead of 21% and 46% for AES and Ascon- ρ, respectively. These factors are more cost-efficient than low-orders masked designs and such mechanisms are sometimes necessary when the inherent noise is not sufficient. However, the joint embedding of the proposed mechanism with masked designs potentially exponentially improve the security level they provide, all whilst enabling electronic-design friendly security mechanism. © 2013 IEEE."

Design/methodology/approach: Plan shape indices proposed to date by the literature for measuring building design complexity are critically reviewed. Building morphology is also dictated by town planning restrictions such as plot coverage ratio or number of storeys. This study analyses historical data collected from 49 residential building projects to develop multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models for forecasting construction cost. Existing plan shape coefficients are calculated to evaluate the geometrical complexity of sampled projects. Ten regression-based cost estimating equations are totally derived from stepwise backward and forward methods, and their predictive accuracy is contrasted: to performance levels reported in past studies and to ANN models developed in this research with multilayer perceptron architecture. Findings: Analysis of plan shape indices revealed that 85.7% of examined past projects possess a high degree of design complexity, hence resulting in expensive initial decisions. This highlights the need for more effective early design stage decision-making by developing new building economic tools. The most accurate regression model, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 19.2%, predicts the log of total cost from wall to floor index and total building envelope surface. Other explanatory variables resulting in MAPE values in the order of 20%–22% are total volume, volume above ground level, gross floor area below ground level, gross floor area per storey and total number of storeys. The overall MAPE of regression-based equations is 24.3% whilst ANN models are slightly more accurate with MAPE scores of 21.8% and 21.6% for one hidden and two hidden layers, respectively. The most accurate forecasting model in the research is the ANN with two hidden layers and the sigmoid activation function which predicts total building cost from total building volume (19.1%). Originality/value: This paper introduces MLR-based and ANN-based conceptual construction cost forecasting models which are founded solely on building morphology design parameters and compare favourably with previous studies with an average predictive accuracy less than 25%. This paper is expected to be beneficial to both practitioners and academics in the built environment towards more effective cost planning of building projects. The methodology suggested can further be implemented in other countries provided that accurate and relevant data from historical projects are used. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

They are even more critical in infrastructure projects as they require more time, cost, and public constraints. Therefore, a better cost model is required for infrastructure projects. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify various statistical modelling techniques and models, as well as models developed using these techniques. The literature identified seven statistical modelling techniques. They are; regression analysis, Monte-Carlo simulation, support vector machine, case-based reasoning, reference class forecasting, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic. These techniques were all used in various cost models developed for construction projects. According to the analysis of results, neural networks and support vector machine-based models displayed better performance in their cost estimation models. However, it was found that combining several techniques into a hybrid model, for example, the neuro-fuzzy hybrid, can significantly increase these results. Thus, the reliability and accuracy of the current estimation process can be improved with these techniques. Finally, the techniques identified as having better performance can be used to develop a cost estimation model for the preliminary stage. This is because these techniques perform well even though the availability of information is lower. The results of this research are limited to the seven identified techniques and the literature used in the review. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

CO2 transportation modes (onshore pipelines, offshore pipelines, and ships) are introduced in this chapter. The design specifications, construction procedures, cost estimation, safety regulations, environmental and risk aspects, energy requirement, international codes and standards, legal issues, and international conventions of these modes are presented and discussed. Furthermore, the challenges and future research directions associated with CO2 transportation are concluded. The large capital and operational costs, integrity, flow assurance, and safety issues are the greatest challenges of CO2 pipeline transports. Substantial efforts must be directed to reduce these costs by improving less energy-intensive configurations. A holistic assessment of the impacts of CO2 impurities on the corrosion rate and the phase change of the transported stream is required to improve pipeline integrity. The influence of impurities and the changes in elevation on the pressure drop along the pipeline needs to be further investigated to ensure continuous flow via accurate positioning of the pumping stations. Although the long experience in the oil and gas pipeline industry forms a powerful reference, it is necessary to develop particular standards and techno-economic frameworks to mitigate the barriers facing CO2 transportation technologies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Usually, general contractors carry a portion of the work and subcontract other parts to eventually submit a holistic joint bid. This bidding setting is referred to as multistage bidding where subcontractors submit their quotations/bids to the general contractor, after which the general contractor submits a final joint bid for the whole project. In a multistage bidding environment, general contractors may be faced with an increase in the probability of negative or below normal profits. Despite previous research efforts for developing bidding models, there is a need for the extension of existing literature to tackle the multistage bidding environment, referred to hereinafter as multistage game (MSG). As such, the goal of this paper is to develop a bidding model for the MSG. The authors followed a multistep research methodology comprised of: (1) defining MSG in terms of game theory; (2) deriving a game-theoretic bid function for general contractors to determine the final joint bid to submit in MSG; and (3) developing a simulation model for MSG, using a data from 2,235 US public infrastructure projects. Results demonstrate that the new bid function gives general contractors a competitive advantage by avoiding the occurrence of negative profits in their part of the project. Also, results show a reduction in the occurrence and magnitude of the negative profits in relation to the final joint bids. This research significantly contributes to the body of knowledge by providing an innovative bid function for MSG. In addition, it offers substantial practical benefits for general contractors by providing a tool that facilitates dealing with the inherent complexity and uncertainties related to actual cost estimation within the MSG decision-making process.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Wood and wooden products have considerable potential for the construction of buildings that satisfy the requirements of sustainable building. However, relevant cost information for wood-based houses is unavailable. This is a barrier to responsible cost estimation in the pre-construction phases of projects, as well as to proper lifecycle-cost analysis and optimisation. The present study had two objectives. The first was to answer the fundamental question of whether the investment costs of wood-based houses are lower than those of brick-based houses, with an emphasis on the construction systems commonly used in the Czech Republic. Ordinary least squares and generalised linear model regression analyses indicated that wood-based houses are 4.3% more expensive than brick-based houses. The second objective of this study was to identify and verify other factors that influence the investment costs of houses in the Czech Republic. The research was conducted using databases containing 1520 catalogue houses with defined specifications and investment costs based on market data. Furthermore, single-floor houses were found to be more expensive than double-floor houses regardless of the material base. The design of easy-shaped houses is preferred to reduce the investment cost. The ‘m’ index was not suitable for reflecting the house shape in the investment cost. © 2022"

In this project, an attempt is made to reduce the cost of the buildings in the super structures, since 70% of the cost of the building has been spent on it. A comparison of detailed estimate for steel as well as concrete has been made. To make the building economical and structurally efficient, the traditional method of load-bearing walls has been avoided by adopting steel framed structure, since the cost of a reinforced concrete-framed structures is high because of the use of cement, sand, and aggregates. Most of the loads are not fully carried by concrete, and hence, the members are not efficient. For this reason, steel super structure is considered here. The optimization on the structural components has been done by adopting techniques like bracings, lightweight floor slabs, roof slabs, and partition walls which are analyzed and designed in ETABS. Generally, the bracings are the structural component that converts lateral load into axial force. Therefore, the moment on the structure has been reduced, and hence, the stability can be improved. As steel structures are prefabricated the assemblies of these systems require less time and environmental factors can also be avoided. The structure can be completed within the stipulated time based on the requirements of the client. Hence, the construction time can be reduced in addition to reduction in the cost of the building.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a quantifying measurement of complexity in the design of a modular automated assembly system. Design/methodology/approach: The configurable assembly system is becoming a trend, which enables companies to quickly respond to changes caused by different product variants but without a large investment. One of the enabling factors is the availability of modular solutions of assembly modules that can be configured according to different technical requirements. This paper develops a methodology using fuzzy evaluation to calculate the design complexity in the design phase for a modular automatic assembly system. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to measure the interaction among the influence factors, to deal with the uncertainty of the judgement. The proposed method investigates three matrices to present how the function-based assembly modules, design complexity factors, part attributes and product components, which are regarded as the main influence factors, complicate the construction of a modular assembly system. The design complexity is derived and quantified based on these assessments. Findings: The proposed approach presents a formal quantification to evaluate the design complexity with regard to a modular assembly system from beginning, which can be identified and used as criteria to indicate the quality of performance and investment cost in advance. A mathematical model based on the fuzzy logic is established to provide both theoretical and practical guidance for the paper. To validate the predictive model, the statistic relationships between the assessed system design complexity, real assembly defect rate and investment cost are estimated based on regression analysis. The application of the presented methodology is demonstrated with regard to a traditional rear drive unit in the automotive industry. Originality/value: This paper presents a developed method, which addresses the measures of complexity found in the design of a modular assembly system. It would help to run the design process with better resource allocation and cost estimation in a quantitative approach. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Industrialization further worsens the environmental degradation and the air quality. Especially, the construction industry contributes higher level of air pollution emanating from the construction sites. To mitigate this adverse situation, a step towards the green infrastructure may be the best solution. This study was carried out at the Panvel node of Navi Mumbai in the Amity University campus area. The study area was delineated using the Google Earth Pro software. The green roof design and cost estimation was carried out for the main building, new boys’ hostel and new building block at the Amity University campus. Extensive green roof design was proposed for the main building and the new boys’ hostel and intensive green roof design was proposed for the new building of Amity University Mumbai campus. Sedum plant was suggested for the construction of green roof in the main building and the new boys’ hostel and Rosemary shrubs were recommended in the main building. Apart from this, any other shrubs like hibiscus plants or any other flower plant can be used to enhance the aesthetic value. The total runoff reduction was found maximum in the new building roof area and estimated as 5524.81 m3 and the design cost was estimated as Rs.26,73,000 for the main building. The water retained due to green roof will help in reducing the temperature and also improve the air quality in the surrounding area. © 2022"

Green building construction contracts are relatively new to the construction industry, where stakeholders have limited experience in contract cost estimation. Unlike con-ventional building construction, green buildings are designed to utilize new technologies to reduce their operations’ environmental and societal impacts. Consequently, green buildings’ construction bidding and awarding processes have become more complicated due to difficulties forecasting the initial construction costs and setting integrated selection criteria for the winning bidders. Thus, ro-bust green building cost prediction modeling is essential to provide stakeholders with an initial construction cost benchmark to enhance decision-making. The current study presents machine learning-based algorithms, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST), deep neural network (DNN), and random forest (RF), to predict green building costs. The proposed models are designed to consider the influence of soft and hard cost-related attributes. Evaluation metrics (i.e., MAE, MSE, MAPE, and R2) are applied to evaluate and compare the developed algorithms’ accuracy. XGBOOST provided the highest accuracy of 0.96 compared to 0.91 for the DNN, followed by RF with an accuracy of 0.87.

At any stage of preparedness of such a project it is important to provide for the most reasonable cost estimate including contingency expenditures. The Russian methodology of cost estimation of oil and gas infrastructure facilities does not provide for evaluation of contingency capital expenditure (CAPEX) beyond local front-end engineering design (FEED) analogue which can lead to a significant risk of underestimation, especially at early stages of projects. International practice embraces examples of complex methodology of contingency assessment. However, as a rule, there are no generally ac-cepted approaches to its assessment which would consider a technological complexity of a particular field facility. The article considers methodology for estimation of the amount of CAPEX contingency using both Russian and international best practices could be used. The methodology is based on authors many years professional experience as well as on a significant database of the built facilities. The methodology involves an assessment on an object-by-object basis which considers a design (planning) stage of a particular facility as well as its technological complexity. In addition, the authors recommend to run a benchmarking exer-cise to determine a mid-industry regional comparative cost. The proposed approach makes it possible to quantify contingency cost funds needed to cover risks of early stages of projects development. At the same time the most risky projects with crucial impact on a final project cost are identified. A correct determination of contingency CAPEX will allow to reduce a risk of budget overrun and increase the probability of achieving the expected prof-itability of the project for the investor. © 2022, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

The manufacturing method includes the assembly of structural parts at a development plant and the transport of them onto the building site as finished or semi-assembled components. For optimization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used because of their capacity to overcome qualitative and quantitative difficulties in the building industry. An ANN is used to execute the input, hidden, and output layers depending on the weight of the hidden layer. Different modeling strategies maximize the layers. ANN covers a wide variety of issues in construction management, for instance cost analysis, decision making, prediction of the mark-up percentage and the production rate in the construction industry. The main advantage of prefabricated methodology is that the procedure is easily done. The other real benefit of the prefabrication process is its integrated versatility. The present study underlines that the total project period and cost are the key considerations in the current job procurement phase in constructing prefabrication.

The necessity of cost estimation is substantiated based on the analysis of the profitability of a new vessel, taking into account specific operating conditions. The difficulties encountered in calculating operating costs are described. The importance of such a component of operating costs as the calculation of fuel consumption on the move and the need to take into account when calculating the operating conditions of the vessel is noted. The results of comparative calculations for predicting the fuel consumption of new ships are presented, and their unsatisfactory accuracy is shown. The lack of accuracy of the existing methods for predicting power at the stage of operational and technical justification is shown. A method for predicting the effective power of main engines based on special hydrodynamic similarity criteria, which has a higher accuracy, is briefly described. A method for calculating the fuel consumption of the main engine is also described, which requires a minimum of initial data on the engine and propellers of a new vessel. The ways of increasing the reliability of the estimation of operating costs by constructing and using a model of the hull-propellers-engine complex, as well as constructing a model of the sailing operation are proposed. An algorithm is proposed for calculating the upper estimate of the construction cost of a vessel at a known freight rate and a given payback period of the vessel.

A conceptual design model with a space layout can be used for the early building evaluation, such as functional spatial validation, circulation and security checking, cost estimation, and preliminary energy consumption simulation. With the development of information technology, existing machine learning methods applied to semantic segmentation of building plan images have successfully identified building elements such as doors, windows, and walls. However, for the higher level of room type/function recognition, the prediction accuracy is low when building plans do not contain sufficient details such as furniture. In this paper, we present a workflow and a predictive model for residential room type classification. Given a building plan image, the building elements are first identified, followed by room feature extraction by connectivity and morphological characterization using a rule-based algorithm. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained with the feature set and then predicts the room type of test samples. We collected 1,586 residential room samples from 165 building layout plans and categorized rooms into nine types.

In recent years, green lightweight plastic aggregate concrete (LWPAC) has been developed as a sustainable material for construction, highlighting financial, time, and quality attributes rather than material properties. However, most studies in this area are directed toward material properties or lifecycle costs in traditional use. Using lifecycle cost analysis, this research comprehensively examines incorporating LWPAC in different building systems to identify the optimal construction system in terms of cost, time, and quality (LCCA). The analyzed building systems extend to include traditional construction method (TM), insulated concrete forms (ICF), tunnel forms (TF), and insulated precast systems (IPS) using green LWPAC. To this end, we conducted a building case study with multiple scenarios related to the selected construction systems. For each scenario, assessments were conducted on the following aspects: (1) structural design of building elements; (2) construction cost and time assessment; (3) LCCA and sensitivity; and (4) quality. Results revealed that LWPAC using TM saves around 10% and 19% in concrete volume and steel quantities, respectively, compared with conventional concrete. The cost estimation results showed that TM using LWPAC is 2.6% higher than conventional concrete, although the LCC was almost the same value, amounting to 75.8 USD/m2. Simultaneously, IPSs maintain the highest savings, at 22%, compared with TM using conventional concrete, with an LCC equal to 64.48 USD/m2. Regarding completion time, there were decreases by 34%, 44%, and 52% for the ICF, TF, and the IPSs, respectively, compared with TM using conventional concrete. IPSs' quality management systems showed the highest mean value of 51.8, followed by ICF, TF, and TM, of 49.9, 49.7, and 48.4, respectively. The findings of this research shed light on the benefits of using LWPAC as an alternative to conventional concrete in different structural systems, which plays a significant role in the overall sustainability of concrete structures.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."

A machine learning approach is designated to address any classification task without requiring the domain knowledge to be explicitly or manually specified in detail. The success of machine learning, however, relies on the quality and suitability of input features. In order to support seamless interoperability of BIM applications, the authors have proposed invariant signatures that uniquely define each AEC object and capture their intrinsic properties. In this paper, the authors combine the use of invariant signatures together with machine learning approach to address BIM object classification. The developed invariant signatures include geometric signatures, locational signatures, and metadata signatures. To test the robustness of their use as machine learning features, the authors created a new BIM object data set with 1,900 AEC objects in five major categories of building elements, including beams, columns, footings, slabs, and walls. The data were manually annotated by independent annotators to ensure the quality. Among those AEC objects in the data set, 1,330 objects (70% of the data) were used as training/development data and 570 objects (30% of the data) were used as testing data. The authors extracted the predefined invariant signatures as features and tested the robustness of them in AEC object classification using different machine learning algorithms. The best-performing algorithm achieved 99.6% F1-measure in the testing data, which outperformed the state of the art (94.9% F1-measure). As a demonstration of the value of such object classification, a comparative experiment was conducted to take off quantities of walls from a student apartment complex, both using the state-of-the-art commercial software and using the object classification-based automation. Consistent results were found between these two quantity takeoff methods, whereas using object classification-based automation further saved time and manual efforts significantly (saved 98.1% of the loading and object selecting time). These results showed that the use of proposed invariant signatures and machine learning algorithms in BIM applications is promising. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."

In the present time, the design and analysis of civil structures are generally carried out by various design software, amongst them E-Tabs and Revit Structures (BIM) are the widely used and leading ones. Revit is one of the widely used applications in the BIM industry, it uses an external application named - Robot Structures for design purposes, whereas ETABS is an analytical and design software. This research work mainly deals with the design and analysis of a multi-story reinforced concrete structure using ETABS and REVIT Structure software separately and a comparison of the results obtained. Both these software's use the Limit State Design principles conforming to the Indian Standard Code of Practice for the design of structures. In this work a G + 10 structure is considered which is subjected to static and dynamic loads like seismic and wind loads, the plan layout includes grids of sizes 3.5 m × 3.5 m with 4 in number in both X and Y directions. The main aim of this research work is to draw an optimum line between the design and cost estimation of RC buildings and to determine which software gives better results, as these projects(buildings) are of low-medium scale, the major factor governing them is the cost of construction. The results include a comparison of variations in shear forces, bending moments values and reinforcement details obtained from both the software. Based on the design data, cost estimation is carried out for the structural members. © 2022"

Proper selection and accurate performance prediction of these machines are very important issues affecting the cost estimation and planning of the projects. However, reliable models for predicting performance of these machines have been quite limited. This study aims to develop empirical performance prediction models for vertical reaming operations (unit penetration rate and specific energy parameters) by using physical-mechanical properties of rock samples, operational parameters of pilot hole drilling and reaming. Field performance data of the pilot hole drilling and reaming operations, as well as rock samples, are collected in different raise excavation projects in Turkey. The evaluation indicates that weight on bit of pilot hole drilling with the rotational speed of reaming and static elasticity modulus of the rocks could be used to predict the field specific energy. Consumed reamerhead torque and indirect tensile strength and dynamic elasticity modulus of rocks could be used to predict the unit penetration rate. © 2022 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association."

Although this has been investigated in previous studies, the underlying assumptions on presuming specific probability distribution functions (like triangular and normal) for activity costs impose curve fitting preliminaries, which leads to approximation errors along with time inefficiency. This paper is sought to propose a fast and exact method to assess the risk of projects for any arbitrary probability mass function of activity costs obtained directly from historical data. The proposed method facilitates determination of cost contingency indicator curves that can help decision makers, planners, and contractors to select a reasonable contract value, and managing resources in predesign phase or during construction more efficiently. Our methodology consists of four main parts: (1) determining the universal generating function (UGF) of activity costs, (2) modeling the project network as a parallel multistate system, (3) determining the UGF of project cost, and (4) determining the probability mass function of project cost. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined using sample projects, indicating that it is 5×105 times faster than Monte Carlo simulation in a 27-activity example, while the average costs obtained from the two methods is not different at a significance level of 0.0001. Moreover, the proposed method provides exact project cost probability distribution in discrete cases unlike Monte Carlo simulation, which does not have the ability to estimate extreme states, and, therefore, it can be a suitable substitution for Monte Carlo simulation.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

These concretes also have the ability to achieve strengths suitable for structural applications. However, each mix design of an alkali-activated concretes is unique and requires a detailed life cycle analysis to determine the environmental impact and cost viability. This study evaluates the feasibility of alkali-activated fly ash or fly ash geopolymer and alkali-activated slag concrete developed for application in Australia currently subject to long term site performance studies. This paper reports a detailed life cycle assessment analysis of these concretes to assess their environmental footprint. The paper considers three distinct allocation methods: baseline, mass, and economic allocation, with two system boundaries: manufacture and construction. The study shows AAS concrete has a lower environmental impact than an equivalent strength PC concrete in two impact categories, global warming potential and eutrophication, while acidification and human toxicity depend on the allocation method applied in the manufacturing stage. The global warming potential (100-years) of AAS is 5.25–35% less than PC concrete. The FAGP concrete has more negative impacts on the environment than PC-based concrete, regardless of which allocation method is applied. The report highlights alkaline activators and transportation of raw materials as the main environmental impact contributors to concrete manufacture. The global warming potential of FAGP is 22–34% higher than the equivalent PC concrete in the baseline method. For the construction stage boundary, machinery appliances for handling concrete and transportation only contributes a small environmental impact (<4%) compared with concrete manufacturing. Cost estimation for concrete production suggests that the cost of the alkali-activated concrete is competitive with the conventional concrete market, dependant on the proximity of the feedstocks and the cost of sodium silicate. Neglecting the transportation cost of feedstocks, the cost of AAS concrete can be 4.8% cheaper, whereas the cost of FAGP concrete is 2.7% more expensive than PC concrete. © 2022"

However, as buildings have been aging simultaneously, the performance of a large number of residential buildings has deteriorated. A government plan to upgrade poor housing performance through renovation is being adopted. However, the difficulty of accurate construction cost prediction in the early stages has a negative effect on the renovation process. Specifically, the relationship between renovation design elements and construction work items has not been clearly revealed. Thus, construction experts use premature intuition to predict renovation costs, giving rise to a large difference between planned and actual costs. In this study, a new approach links the renovation design elements with construction work items. Specifically, it effectively quantifies design factors and applies data-driven estimation using the simulation-based deep learning (DL) approach. This research contributes the following. First, it improves the reliability of cost prediction for a data-scarce renovation project. Moreover, applying this novel approach greatly reduces the time and effort required for cost estimation. Second, several design alternatives were effectively examined in an earlier stage of construction, leading to prompt decision-making for homeowners. Third, rapid decision-making can provide a more sustainable living environment for residents. With this novel approach, stakeholders can avoid a prolonged economic evaluation by selecting a better design alternative, and thus can maintain their property holdings in a smarter way. © 2022 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The various reasons for delay include practicing conventional planning strategies and execution. Indian construction industries, therefore, need smart tools to overcome any such challenges in the future.

The earlier studies estimated that implementation of BIM reduces project costs by 20%. It will help improve the quality of work with proper planning and adhering to the project cost and duration.

The aim of this research is to determine the optimum wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) technology among performance convergent technologies that utilize a small footprint and comply with environmental Egyptian regulations, with a focus on their economic cost. Three wastewater treatment technologies: intermittent cycle extended aeration system (ICEAS), moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and complete mix activated sludge (CMAS) were proposed, and simulated using GPS-X and CapdetWorks software to predict performances, calculate and compare the capital, operation and maintenance costs for them. The GPS-X simulation results for the three technologies performance proved that all these technologies can achieve effluent concentrations that comply with environmental Egyptian regulations. CapdetWorks cost estimation results demonstrated that; ICEAS aeration tank construction cost was higher than MBBR and CMAS technologies, and despite, that the MBBR aeration tank having a lower volume, the construction of CMAS system aeration tanks was less in cost (13.5% less), but the construction cost of MBBR’s gravity thickeners and drying beds was less expensive than ICEAS and CMAS systems. The total construction cost was 19.6, 17.1 and 17.7 M $ and the operation and maintenance costs were 1.8, 1.5 and 2.1 M $/y, for ICEAS, MBBR and CMAS WWTPs, respectively.

One of the nuclear industry's proposed remedies is the small modular reactor (SMR). SMR designs leverage five factors to be more economically competitive than large reactors: 1) multiple units; 2) increased factory production and learning; 3) reduced construction schedules; 4) plant design simplification and 5) unit timing. There are currently no bottom-up studies that quantitatively account for these factors and compare different near-term light water reactor SMRs with Gen III + large plants. This work presents a nuclear plant cost estimating methodology using a detailed bottom-up approach for over 200 structures, systems, and components. The results compare relative costs for two large pressurized water reactors, one with active safety and one with passive safety, to two SMR designs, one with multiple reactor power modules and one with a single reactor module. Passive safety systems showed noticeable savings at both the large and small-scale reactors. The power uprating of an SMR by 20% resulted in ∼15% savings in the overnight unit capital cost. Overall, if built by an inexperienced vendor and work force, the two SMRs' overnight costs were higher than large reactors, since significant on-site labor still remains while losing economy of scale. However, the single-unit SMR had significantly less total person-hours of onsite labor, and if built by an experienced workforce, it could avoid cost-overrun risks associated with megaprojects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

In the government sector, the USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has implemented building information modeling (BIM) for bridge construction. Hence, state DOTs are now faced with heightened pressure in complying with the FHWA's Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM) standardization. Although BIM can provide many benefits to DOTs, current BIM-based platforms for bridges are not fully developed to process traditional two-dimensional (2D) bridge drawings for BIM-based computational tasks involving existing bridges, for example cost estimation. Bridges are a critical infrastructure in any nation's economy, and by law the DOTs are tasked with ensuring that they remain safe for use. To maintain bridges, engineers currently perform periodic inspections, assessing each part of the bridge to identify areas that require maintenance. Maintenance work items are then generated for these areas; these are usually computed traditionally or by systems that still rely heavily on manual inputs. Such processes are time-consuming and cumbersome, and depend on years of bridge technical expertise. To overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy of processes such as generating maintenance work items for bridges, we propose a framework for automatically (1) processing existing 2D bridge drawings for bridges built pre-BIM adoption in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry; (2) converting these record drawings into three-dimensional (3D) information models; and (3) converting 3D information models into industry foundation class (IFC) files. The developed 3D models using the proposed framework were compared against developed 3D models using the state-of-the-art method. Experimental results show that the developed framework can be used in developing algorithms that generate 3D models and IFC output files from portable document format (PDF) bridge drawings in a semiautomated fashion. The proposed method uses 3.33% of the time it takes the current state-of-the-art method to generate a 3D model, and the generated models are of comparative quality. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

How-ever, the current construction-oriented QTO practice relies on estimators’ manual interpretation of work descriptions and manual processes to look up proper building objects for quantity calculation. Hence, this research aims to develop natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based algorithms to automate the information extraction (IE) from work descriptions for QTO in building construction. Specifically, several named entity recognition (NER) models, including Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Conditional Random Field (CRF), Bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Bi-LSTM+CRF, were developed to identify construction activities, material, building component, product features, measurement unit, and additional information (e.g., work scope) from work descriptions. Cost items in the RSMeans database are used to evaluate the developed models in terms of F1 scores. HMM was found to achieve a 5% higher F1 score in the NER than the other three algorithms. Then, labeling rules and active learning strategies were applied along with the HMM model, which improved F1 score by 3% and reduced the labeling efforts by 26%. The results showed that the proposed IE method successfully interprets the desired information from the work description for QTO.

However, BIM adoption approaches have attracted significant attention with this respect. Since BIM models are object-based with built-in parametric information, it is easier to capture the quantities of building elements and deliver more accurate estimates with less errors and omissions. As most of the current cost estimation standards are designed and developed based on old-fashioned construction project delivery systems, a lack of compatibility between their classification and BIM-based informatics is observed. This study, therefore, aims to develop an informatics framework to integrate a cost estimation standard with BIM in order to expedite the 5D BIM process and enhance the digital transformation practices in construction projects. The developed framework is considered to be a new approach which can automatically estimate the cost of building elements using machine learning-integrated algorithms and MATLAB engine for its effective implementation. © 2022, The Author(s)."

As the cost of the entire development process continues to rise, an effective mechanism is needed to estimate the required development cost to control better the cost overrun problem and make the final software product more competitive. However, in the early stages of planning, the project managers have difficulty estimating the realistic value of the effort and cost required to execute development activities. Software evaluation prior to development can minimize risk and upsurge project success rates. Many techniques have been suggested and employed for cost estimation. However, computations based on several of these techniques show that the estimation of development effort and cost vary, which may cause problems for software industries in allocating overall resources costs. The proposed research study proposes the artificial neural network (ANN) based Neural-Evolution technique to provide more realistic software estimates in the early stages of development. The proposed model uses the advantages of the topology augmentation using an evolutionary algorithm to automate and achieve optimality in ANN construction and training. Based on the results and performance analysis, it is observed that software effort prediction using the proposed approach is more accurate and better than other existing approaches. © 2022, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

BIM is created and used mainly by the owner. By default, the designer, contractor, and supplier are shared and treated by all parties as an advanced medium of technical and visual communication. In the last few years, and many developed countries, BIM documents, and related legal provisions have become mandatory in construction projects contract documents by public and private owners and project stakeholders as best practice. The authors observed that although some projects in Saudi Arabia have used BIM, it is still not as widely used as it is supposed to be. It is apparent to the authors that the leap of using BIM in the Saudi Construction Industry without proper provisions in the contract documents among the construction project stakeholders will create confusion. The paper explores the current status and trend of using BIM in the construction industry and related difficulties and challenges to using BIM in Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, based on those investigated results, the paper proposes the basic guidelines for applying BIM following the situation of the national construction industry in Saudi Arabia.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

In some nations of the world today, especially some developing nations, many of the federal roads constructed were not performing up to their designed expectations, thus, causing formation of potholes, road surfaces cracking, swaying of road surfaces, road accidents and bad road-drainage structure. The poor drainage system contributed highly to these road defects. Hence, this article provides the standard design and setting out measures for drainage's construction, and for the reduction in its construction cost. In the experiment, the theodolite device was set at an intersectional point (I.P) from chain-ages 8 + 250 to 8 + 417 of Ogbomoso - Oko -Osogbo road. At each I.P, poles were bisected within I.P to I.P1 and I.P to I.P2.The excavated trenches were marked out with pegs for drainage construction. At the bisection of pole 6 and pole B, the excavated depths of the marked areas were increased by 42.3% and 31.4% than the areas with the mean excavation depths compared with other points. Thus, the costs of drainage construction at those points were increased by $2,175.58 and $1,277.32 respectively. This resulted into inflation in the costs of drainage construction at those areas. This construction cost increment was controlled by effective taken off, accurate quantification of project works and standard project's cost estimation. It was concluded that accurate design calculations, good drainage's setting out and project's cost estimation will prevent the construction engineers from run into lost or have excessive spending during the construction of drainage system. © 2022 MIM Research Group.

Such estimates overlook influencing parameters known in the planning phase and the importance of building reliable databases to support decision making. Meanwhile, it is possible to generate meaningful predictions in early stages of project development based on historical data gathering and analysis. The present research introduces a newly developed method for conceptual cost and duration estimation for public highway projects utilizing an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models and data collected for projects completed between 2004 and 2015 (roads, bridges, and drainage projects). Unlike previous studies, the proposed method includes project parameters that affect construction durations and costs and were not studied simultaneously before. The parameters considered are facility type, project scope, highway type, length, width, location, level of technical complexity, and new parameters pertinent to payment and procurement methods. The developed method was tested using 29 and 56 randomly selected projects, and the results yielded a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.4% and 4.5% for the duration and cost, respectively, which are lower than the estimation errors of methods reported in recent literature. Additionally, the generalization abilities were assessed by the Mann-Whitney test, and the developed method is found to successfully handle diverse projects. Thus, machine learning models can assist agencies in the review process of competing projects from a high-level management perspective to ultimately develop better management execution programs. © 2022 The author(s)."

Despite the professional effort and adaptation of advanced technologies, still the construction industry experiences cost overruns. Especially, among many stakeholders, contracting organizations are one of the key stakeholders that would be highly affected by the construction cost overrun. Poor coordination between the pre & post-contract stages in the contracting organizations has been a critical issue over many decades which leads to cost overruns. Professionals involved in the pre-contract stage have not possessed the knowledge regarding the significance of the cost overrun factors that may appear in the post-contract stage and vice versa. Therefore, this research aims to comparatively analyze the significance of cost overrun factors in the pre & post-contract stages in Sri Lankan construction projects from the perspective of industry professionals. A total of 5 semi-structured interviews were conducted among professionals who have experience in cost estimation and post-contract cost management in contracting organization to categorize the selected cost overrun factors into pre-contract and/or post-contract stages. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted to evaluate the significance of those categorized cost overrun factors. A total of 80 responses were collected from the questionnaire survey and the data were analyzed using statistical analysis. Then the quantitative data was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. The results of the Mann-Whitney U test concluded that there is a statistically significant difference between the perspective of professionals involved in the pre & post-contract stage. © 2022, Ceylon Institute of Builders.

Most of them are based on projects' characteristics only while neglecting the external economic factors. This may be partially because there is no consensus on the effects of the economic factors on construction cost estimation and little attention has been paid to incorporating the trend of economic factors into cost estimation. More importantly, there is a general lack of quantitative analysis. To explore those effects quantitatively, this study uses deep neural networks (DNN) as an estimator and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as a model interpreter, adopting the data on 98 public school projects in Hong Kong SAR. The analysis is also verified by a comparison analysis using several machine learning models popular in construction cost estimation. The results indicate that the economic factors do play an important role in reducing the construction cost estimation errors and are even more important than projects' characteristics.

The proposed system integrates four main modules: an algorithm known as the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), the simple multi-attribute ranking technique (SMART), an experience-based algorithm, and a system database. The AHP module assesses the importance of the selection criteria, while SMART applies multi-attribute utility theory. The experience-based algorithm completes the calculations necessary for selecting the best and most technically appropriate crane alternative, and the database module hosts information about 37 different mobile cranes. The methodology followed to achieve the research objective consisted of three main phases. The first involved conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify selection criteria for mobile cranes, as well as a number of face-to-face interviews with experts to finalize the list of selection criteria considered. Face-to-face interviews were also conducted with local experts to obtain a framework for the current practice of crane selection and identify areas in need of improvement. Phase two involved using AHP for data collection in order to assess the importance of the identified criteria. The final phase included an analysis of the collected information and development of a computer application. The system was tested on a hypothetical project and validated using a real-world endeavor to demonstrate its effectiveness for a number of construction management functions, including project planning, scheduling, cost estimation, and the efficient use of available resources.

The share of individual investment phases in the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced for the construction and use of buildings depends mainly on the materials used and the implemented design solutions. In accordance with the idea of sustainable construction, materials and design solutions with the lowest possible carbon footprint should be used. This can be achieved by using natural building materials, materials subjected to appropriate chemical composition modifications, or materials in which their production does not require large amounts of energy. The aim of the article is to determine the value of the purchase costs of selected road materials (concrete paving blocks, cement-sand bedding, concrete curbs, semi-dry concrete and concrete underlay, washed sand, and crushed aggregate with a fraction of 0–31.5 mm) for the implementation of a road investment. In addition, the authors focused on determining the size of the embodied carbon footprint due to GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and GHG removals in a product system, expressed as CO2 equivalents for the same materials that were subjected to cost analyzes. The article presents the results of original analyzes, and indicates the optimal solutions in terms of minimizing the cost of purchasing road materials and minimizing the carbon footprint.

However, given the uncertainties in the planning phase, it is challenging to estimate PE costs effectively and efficiently. The purpose of this study was to provide DOTs with a PE cost estimation method using different ratios of PE cost to construction cost for bridge projects by project type and size. To that end, the study tested the variability of PE costs by analyzing 628 Texas DOT bridge construction projects divided into three project types: bridge maintenance (BMN), bridge replacement (BR), and bridge widening and rehabilitation (BWR). The analysis found that the ratios of PE cost to construction cost for the BMN and BR project types were significantly different by project size, but was not conclusive for the BWR project type because of limited sample size. The validation results indicate that the proposed method is effective for planning and estimating the PE costs of a portfolio of projects.

The rising demand of most consumed aggregate in construction can be effectively compensated by the alternative material like scoria which lavishly exists in the western region. Scoria is characterized as lightweight aggregate beneficially used to develop lightweight concrete (LWC) - a potential alternative of normal weight concrete (NWC) ensuring reduction in the structural element’s size, increase in building height, comparatively lighter foundation, etc. Hence, the goal of this study is to incorporate scoria-based structural lightweight concrete and evaluate its impact on superstructure and foundation design beside contributing to the economy of construction. Fresh, mechanical, and rheological properties of the novel LWC have been investigated. The structural analyses employ the NWC as well as LWC based structures under seismic and wind loadings. The commercial finite element package - ETABS was employed to find out the change in structural responses and foundations. The cost estimation and SWOT analysis for superstructure and foundation have also been carried out. It was revealed that the developed LWC enabled a more flexible structural design. Notable reduction in the steel and concrete prices of LWC might be possible in the low-rise building. It is postulated that the cost-effective and eco-friendly LWC will promote the usage of scoria as an effective alternative in Saudi Arabia and GCC countries for structurally viable LWC construction. © 2022 Techno-Press, Ltd.

This study develops a cost estimation model applicable to the construction of hydrogen pipelines and conducts an economic analysis to evaluate various scenarios for hydrogen pipeline construction. As a result, the cost of modifying an existing natural gas to a hydrogen pipeline is the lowest, however, there are issues with the safety of the modified hydrogen pipes from natural gas and the necessity of the existing natural gas pipelines. In the case of a short-distance hydrogen pipeline, the cost is about 1.8 times that of the existing natural gas pipeline modification, but it is considered a transitional scenario before the construction of the main hydrogen pipeline nationwide. Lastly, in the case of long-distance main hydrogen pipeline construction, it takes about 3.7 times as much cost as natural gas pipeline modification, however it has the advantage of being the ultimate hydrogen pipeline network. In this study, various hydrogen pipeline establishment scenarios ware compared. These results are expected to be utilized to establish plans for building hydrogen pipelines and to evaluate their economic feasibility. © 2022 by the authors."

Previous studies have provided a conceptual scheme and quantity take-off tool improving the speed and accuracy of construction cost management (CMM) work. However, cost management requires cross-functional coordination and internal iterations - an efficient environment for data communication and computation. This study developed an ontology-based system to conceptualize CCM knowledge in terms of stages and disciplines. Multiple ontology models and their associated concepts, properties, and rules are extracted from extensive literature and expert interviews to describe CCM procedures for cost estimation and cost management. With the development of data infrastructure and operation platforms presented here, information necessary for and deriving from cost management work is simultaneously updated in the database and distributed following inference rules. Empowered by the model, organizations can save time for planning and decision-making through automatic data reuse and disposal. Construction cost has been well controlled in development, with an average deviation of 2% in our local application.

However, owing to limited accessibility of information, the level of accuracy required at this stage of a project is extremely difficult to be attained. In like manner, the risks of budget shortages or cost overruns are likely to surge exponentially due to an incompetent or a lackadaisical approach towards life-cycle costing. Hence, this study proposes BIM-based VR as a preliminary estimating solution which is purported to nip the aforementioned issues in the bud. BIM-VR enables BQ to be updated automatically as stakeholders performs modifications on-the-go, allowing speedy and highly accurate design adjustments throughout the project. On this front, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was adopted to determine the acceptance level of BIM-based VR technology in Malaysia. Data was acquired via a questionnaire survey, of which 92 out of 180 distributions were accepted for analysis, accounting to a respectable response rate of 51%. Consequentially, Principal Component Analysis result revealed that ‘Saving Cost and Resources' is the most significant factor for BIM acceptance. Conversely, ‘Presence of Skill Gap' was found to be the biggest stumbling block for BIM-based VR in cost estimation. Relationship analysis from the TAM also unveiled that the challenges of BIM-based VR did not produce mediating effect towards attitude and intention to use. This implies that the intention of construction professionals to adopt the technology wasn't impeded by its challenges. Significantly, this study served as a benchmark in uncovering new possibilities of BIM and VR in project cost management, where the reliability and accuracy of conventional procurement can be enhanced with technology, particularly in BQ documentation, to fulfill the rising expectations of construction stakeholders across the globe. © 2022 International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction.

However, due to the employment of different BIM software tools or platforms among different stakeholders, inconsistent or missing data are usually observed, which leads to difficulty in data communication and therefore low-working efficiency. To address that, an information checking, provision, and application process (ICPAP) framework was proposed in this paper with three main functions: model information analysis, guided information provision, and information consumption application (e.g., cost estimation). Algorithms developed under this framework can automatically integrate and check information from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models to guide information provision to further feed other information consumption services. An experiment was conducted to test the framework at the material information level, in which a 12-storey model was selected to conduct information analysis and information provision based on customized input requirements of concrete material, to serve further BIM applications (e.g., structural analysis and cost estimation). The evaluation was conducted from time efficiency and accuracy perspectives in comparison with pure manual operation, which demonstrated that the proposed framework led to higher performance on time efficiency and accuracy compared to a manual procedure. It enables the information communication from decentralized platforms to a centralized BIM, and considers the application needs during the checking to facilitate automated information provision suggestion for targeted applications. The proposed framework provides a new approach to facilitate BIM enrichment to better serve Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) applications. © 2022 ASCE."

BIM is also a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration at all levels, which enables modelling, design, operation and maintenance of systems throughout their life span. Benefits of BIM include time-saving, quicker cost estimation, minimization of processes to implement changes, integrated sustainability and life cycle cost, optimization in the use of energy including through daylight analysis, thermal design, timely detection of human errors, efficient risk management, operations and maintenance, and quantity take-off during the pre-construction phase. BIM therefore enhances conventional design approaches while embedding the sustainability aspect for improved building prototyping. In the present paper, a survey review was carried out to quantify the importance of BIM for the creation of environmentally sustainable designs. The investigation also reports on a thorough review of literature to assess its viability and relevance. The scope of this paper is therefore to provide a complete overview of BIM from a research perspective. © 2022, Jordan University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved."

The present paper intends to help engineers evaluate and maintain bridges by developing a comprehensive bridge maintenance planning framework (BMPF) within financial and performance constraints. The paper's objectives are to maximize the performance condition level of bridges and to minimize the maintenance cost by optimally planning the maintenance treatments. The framework includes bridge performance impact assessment, machine learning models, multi-attribute utility theory ranking model and genetic algorithm optimization model. The study analysed 95 bridges in a network with an 84% accuracy machine learning model prediction. Decision-makers' preferences were considered to rank all bridges using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory. 19 bridges were then chosen for maintenance based on budget and performance using a genetic algorithm model. The BMPF was observed to improve project productivity, reduce down time, and improve bridge inventory condition. Future research can explore the use of other optimization approaches and also include traffic flow and construction cost analysis for a better maintenance cost estimation. The machine learning model for performance prediction can be enhanced by utilizing different techniques. © 2022"

In Libya, construction projects often face challenges due to the lack of proper information and data in cost-estimation methods. The primary goal of this paper is to demonstrate the estimation of construction costs using various methods. An optimization strategy based on a well-known robust algorithm The Fuzzy AHP technique is used to estimate the best roof structure choice based on cost rank among one or two-way flat slab, post-tension slab, pre-tension slab, waffle slab, and hollow core slab. The roofs were created employing five main factors that were implemented in a real-world situation in the Libyan building industry. The cost of materials, labor, machinery, transportation, and trash on site were all considered. Research findings show that the models can assist decision-makers in determining the cost rank of roof selection. When a range of methods are applied and compared to guarantee that this is the best option. This research study must be taken seriously when estimating and managing the contract and length of highway construction projects in the early stages of project development so that the time difference at the end of the project can be kept to a minimum by decision-makers when choosing the roof with the lowest cost. © 2022 by the authors.

For the past ten years, performance benchmarking has been a standard practice to analyze, optimize well durations and the related costs. Operators, rig contractors, and service companies have focused on reducing and mitigating Non-Productive Time (NPT) and Invisible Lost Time (ILT). However, mitigation of NPT and ILT remains a challenge for operations, largely due to ineffective procedures and monitoring tools. Operations teams are continuously challenged in the pre-planning phase and during the operational phase to optimize drilling time and reduce related well construction costs by setting the targets to best practice benchmarks. Currently, standard performance benchmarking in geothermal drilling does not utilize pre-planning analysis and real-time Key Performance Indicator (RT KPI) monitoring. The presented paper highlights the importance of both, presents the concept and the procedures which result in the reduction of ILT, and show how performance benchmarking optimizes drilling time and cost. Methods in the pre-planning phase and during the operational phase improve the operating procedures by implementing pre-planning tools, real-time monitoring tools and centralizing KPIs. The real-time monitoring tool utilizes surface sensor data that generates real-time KPIs. The procedure uses monitoring based on sensor data and utilizes centralized KPIs to define best practices. The best practices are then applied as a benchmark for upcoming drilling campaigns. Using KPI offset data from previously drilled wells makes the well planning easier and more accurate in terms of time and cost estimation resulting in faster planning. Simulating the same plan with different available rigs and their performance KPIs provides the engineer with a powerful comparison tool to find the best and most cost-efficient rig to drill the well of interest. Furthermore, the results show the requirement for permanent monitoring of changes to well engineering and operation efforts to establish Best of the Best (BotB) practices to avoid service quality issues that lead to NPT and the reduction or elimination of ILT. Using KPI driven well planning, including an automated operation sequence simulation saves time in the pre-planning phase. The time and cost estimations provide quality working material to review and work forward towards the process steps until the final plan. Finally, a public platform to compare and benchmark performance of global drilling activities and service providers is suggested to optimize performance of the industry and reduce cost of geothermal drilling in general, making this form of energy more competitive. © 2022 Geothermal Resources Council.

The envisaged infrastructure, designed to include both habitation and industrial settlements, will be carved inside a Near Earth Asteroid to be captured and moved to such destination in the cislunar space region. The solution will solve both the main threats to civilian life in outer space: rotation will provide artificial gravity 1g and protection against cosmic radiation and solar flares. Being the living volumes obtained inside the body of the asteroid, many meters of rock will be opposed to incoming radiation and micrometeorites. The paper will also describe the mining process to dig a cave of at least half of the asteroid's volume. This cave will contain the rotating living and agricultural facilities for some thousand inhabitants. The various materials produced by mining can be used for construction. Oxygen, hydrogen and carbon can be extracted if the chosen asteroid is carbonaceous. Natural sunlight can be collected outside the asteroid by parabolic mirrors and beamed into the cave through a central tunnel. The goal is to provide in the long run a closed self-sustainable biosphere. The industrial plants and the harbour with docking facilities will be built as non-rotating modular structures outside the asteroid hull. The paper includes a conceptual study and some basic requirements, to facilitate further stages of the project, i.e. feasability and cost estimations.

Project cost is a complex engineering problem due to various factors affecting the construction industry. Accurate cost estimation is important in construction management and significantly impacts project performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been effectively implemented in construction management studies in recent years owing to their capability to deal with complex problems. In this research, extreme gradient boosting is developed as an advanced input selector algorithm and coupled with three AI models, including random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) for cost estimation. Datasets were gathered based on a survey conducted on 90 building projects in Iraq. Statistical indicators and graphical methods were used to evaluate the developed models. Several input predictors were used, and XGBoost highlighted inflation as the most crucial parameter. The results indicated that the best prediction was attained by XGBoost-RF using six input parameters, with r-squared and the mean absolute percentage error equal to 0.87 and 0.25, respectively. The comparison results revealed that all AI models showed good prediction performance when applied to datasets affected by more than two parameters. The outcomes of this research revealed an optimistic strategy that can help decision makers select the influencing parameters in the early phases of project management.

For addressing the limited data availability in conceptual cost estimation, this study proposes an enhanced ANN-based cost estimating model that incorporates artificial neural networks, ensemble modeling and a factor analysis approach. Design/methodology/approach: In the ANN-based conceptual cost estimating model, the ensemble modeling component enhances training, and thus, improves its predictive accuracy and stability when project data quantity is low; and the factor analysis component finds the optimal input for an estimating model, rendering explanations of project data more descriptive. Findings: On the basis of the results of experiments, it can be concluded that ensemble modeling and FAMD (Factor Analysis of Mixed Data) are both conjointly capable of improving the accuracy of conceptual cost estimates. The ANN model version combining bootstrap aggregation and FAMD improved estimation accuracy and reliability despite these very low project sample sizes. Research limitations/implications: The generalizability of the findings is hard to justify since it is difficult to collect cost data of construction projects comprehensively. But this difficulty means that our proposed approaches and findings can provide more accurate and stable conceptual cost forecasting in the early stages of project development.

The construction activities are modeled for the 909 dataset, which includes costs, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time. The results indicate that the mean absolute percentage error values of the RAC cost, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time (including recycled aggregate production and RAC production processes) are 1.98, 28.21, and 2.96, respectively. The mean squared error values of RAC cost, concrete volume for construction, and total construction time are 56,979, 20.9, and 0.56, respectively. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (R2) of RAC cost, concrete volume, and construction time of concrete were calculated at 0.999, 0.976, and 0.968, respectively. Both statistical values indicate that the ANN modeling technique is well implemented for constructing RAC. The results also indicate that ANN modeling can be effectively used in time series for predicting the construction activities of making RAC products. The outcomes offer benefits to stakeholders in construction activities, including improved cost estimations, reduced waste from less concrete going unused, and more accurate project scheduling. ANN modeling represents a relatively simple prediction and can be adopted in preconstruction stages, such as project planning and investment decision making, leading to sustainable construction. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,."

While many scholars and professionals treat the level of mark-up as a technical problem, others acknowledge the role of professional judgement. This paper uses the neo-institutional concept of ‘hybrid institutional logics’ and an exploratory study into two projects in one firm to explore the way in which different types of professionals work together to produce a single price. The research documents the existence of two distinct logics: a first-principles cost estimation logic and strategic mark-up logic. These are combined in a highly structured process, with moments of separation, bridging and demarcation.

It will describe how much the capital cost should be spent on the project. In the early project, it is difficult to get the appropriate cost estimation for a specific design. However, getting the high accuracy is very complex, expensive, and time-consuming due to requiring much information about the project. In the last decade, many GEPP (gas engine power plant) projects already have been constructed. The previously executed projects could be the reference for the cost estimation for the next project. Those data could be analyzed for the EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) approximation equation. Based on this data, the study developed the cost estimation equation. This study was assumed that categorized as Class 5 of AACE (Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering). The approximation equation was developed by using a least-squares method which is expressed with a non-linear family equation. The unit is expressed by cost index unit in USD/kW with input variable of power output in MW. The additional coefficient was added to distinguish the cost for each region. The approximation equation has been validated by other methods and verified by the actual feasibility studies. However, this estimation can describe how much the cost shall be budgeted before the project is executed easily. The estimation is intended for budgetary purposes and not be able for bidding evaluation due to less of a project definition. © 2021 IEEE."

However, due to several factors, cost overruns often emerge when executing a project. The purpose of this study is to analyze the dominant factor which leads to cost overruns on the drinking water distribution project in Banda Aceh. This study used primary data that were obtained by distributing questionnaires to contractors that are registered in LPJK company association of Aceh in 2020 and have ever been involved in the installation of drinking water pipes in Banda Aceh between 2015-2020. The population of this research was 62 contractors. By using Slovin equations, 54 contractors were selected as a sample of this research for a 5 percentile margin of error. The dominant factor that leads to cost overruns in drinking water distribution projects in Banda Aceh was caused by cost estimation factor with a mean value of 4,417.

Nowadays, the magnitude of this problem is completely unsustainable with cases of ""billionaire"" cost overruns all over the world. Previous works stresses the role of risk management as one of the best systems for understanding the key aspects of the project that give rise to these deviations, as well as controlling and mitigating them. The main objective of the work is the development of a methodology that allows the identification of those risks that most influence the cost overruns of a specific project portfolio, associating them to the different stages of the project, in order to make a preferential distribution of control resources. To achieve this objective, the methodology uses techniques based on Artificial Intelligence, specifically SOM modelling. Furthermore, in order to link the risks to the stages of the project, the methodology proposes a parameterisation of the costs throughout the life cycle of the project by means of a Beta distribution.

Various models have been proposed to estimate the TBM performance. However, most of these models used the parameters of rock specimens acquired from the laboratory tests, which differed from the in-situ conditions. It is difficult to apply these models to the engineering practice. In the present study, to overcome these limitations, an in-situ indentation testing system for the force-penetration response was proposed and applied to a TBM-excavated tunnel. A database that integrates 33 groups of in-situ indentation testing (235 tests in total) and the corresponding TBM operating parameters was established, including 12 indentation indices extracted from the force-penetration curve and 6 operating parameters recorded by the TBM. A series of correlation analysis was carried out to investigate the relationships between these indices/parameters. The analysis indicates that the 12 indentation indices are highly or moderately correlated with each other. A similar phenomenon was found in the TBM operating parameters. Consequently, four indentation indices and one operating parameter (field penetration index, FPI) were selected to establish the predictive models. Predictive models of the TBM performance (FPI) with high correlation coefficient (r = 0.960) were proposed using the multiple indices obtained from the in-situ indentation testing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

As a result of the high level of risk and uncertainty present during the early stages of projects, the reliability of these estimations during project planning remains poor. This study argues that this reliability can be improved through using the ‘concept of stratification’. This concept considers a set of states and describes a system that receives inputs (associated with outputs), based on which the system transitions from one state to another. This provides a unique structure that is capable of considering uncertainty related to events that may occur during a project. This paper explains how the concept of stratification can be used to compute estimations of the time and cost of activities involved in a project. The method is illustrated with a construction project that has uncertain events. By determining specific activities’ estimated time and cost, the project's estimated time and cost can also be calculated. Thus, the proposed method increases the reliability of estimations of projects’ completion time and cost. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

The findings of this database are part of several contributions in this special issue. This contribution presents the database in its basic structure, deals with its evaluation with regard to typical steel fibre mixtures, scatterings in the tensile behaviour as well as the frequently discussed correlation between fibre content and material characteristics. For this purpose, the test data are summarised in individual categories based on the characteristic parameters of concrete compressive strength, fibre slenderness, fibre's tensile strength and content. For each of these categories, the upper (95 % quantile) and lower limit (5 % quantile) as well as the average achieved flexural residual tensile strength are determined. © 2021, Ernst und Sohn.

While traditional bottom-up cost estimation is a very time consuming and know-how intensive process, intelligent machine learning methods have the potential to significantly reduce the effort in the cost estimation process. In this paper, a literature review on intelligent cost estimation methods for parts to be procured in the manufacturing industry is carried out by text mining. Following the results of this literature review, building blocks for an intelligent cost estimation system are outlined that comprise cost estimation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, methods for multi-level cost estimation, and methods for interpreting the results of the cost analysis. Regarding cost estimation methods, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines outperform established linear regression algorithms. Dimensionality reduction methods like Correlation Analysis or Principal Component Analysis are rarely studied. Nevertheless, they contribute a lot to the reduction of expensively provided input parameters for cost estimation. Methods for multi-level cost estimation, that support cost prediction of parts and assemblies following the construction plan of a vehicle, and methods for interpretation of intelligent cost analytics cannot be found at all in literature. Consequently, in this paper corresponding approaches are derived from the areas of Multitask Learning and Explainable Machine Learning.

Pipe and labor costs are subject to considerable fluctuations over time. These fluctuations are problematic for cost estimation and bid preparation in pipeline projects, which are mostly large and long-term projects. The accurate prediction of pipe and labor costs is invaluable for cost estimators to prepare accurate bids and manage the cost contingencies. However, the existing literature does not take advantage of the leading indicators of pipeline construction cost time series to accurately forecast cost fluctuations in pipeline projects. The objective of this research is to identify the leading indicators of pipeline construction costs and develop multivariate time series models for forecasting cost fluctuations in pipeline projects. Nineteen potential leading indicators of pipe and labor costs were initially selected based on a comprehensive review of construction cost forecasting literature. The leading indicators were identified from this pool of potential leading indicators based on unit root tests and Granger causality tests. Multivariate time series models were developed based on the results of cointegration tests. Vector error correction (VEC) models were developed for the cointegrated variables, while vector autoregressive (VAR) models were developed for the non-cointegrated variables. Since multivariate time series models include information from the identified leading indicators, multivariate time series models are often expected to deliver more accurate forecasts than univariate time series models. The forecasting accuracies of multivariate time series models were compared with those of univariate time series models based on three common error measures: mean absolute prediction error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean average error (MAE). The results show that multivariate time series models outperform univariate models for forecasting cost fluctuations in pipeline projects. The findings of this research contribute to the state of knowledge by identifying leading indicators of pipe and labor costs and developing multivariate time series models to forecast them. The multivariate time series models with leading indicators are more accurate than univariate models for forecasting cost fluctuations in pipeline projects. It is expected that the proposed multivariate time series forecasting models contribute to the enhancement of the theory and practice of pipeline construction cost forecasting and help cost engineers and investment planners to prepare more accurate bids, cost estimates, and budgets for pipeline projects. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The study evaluated the sources, frequency and significance of construction estimating risks, using data from a questionnaire survey of 206 quantity surveyors in Nigeria. The data were analysed using factor analysis, Fussy Set Theory, Terrell Transformation Index (TTI), and Kruskal Wallis H tests. The results showed that estimating risks are correlate seven principal sources, namely: Estimating resources, construction knowledge, design information, economic condition, the expertise of estimator, geographic factor, cost data, and project factors (λ, > 0.70 <1.0). Twenty-nine risk factors likewise emerged critical construction estimation risks (TTI, 69-87 > 65 percent) and the top three were low construction knowledge, inaccurate cost information and changes in government regulations (factor scores > 0.60 > 0.50). The awareness and accurate assessment of these risks into project cost estimation would reduce cost overrun. The study, therefore, recommends synergies between projects' internal/external environments for proper scoping of these risks into project estimates. © 2021 Journal of Engineering, Project, and Production Management.

Often, due to the time constraints imposed by the design schedule and budget restrictions, the number of design alternatives considered is limited. This research focuses on composite flooring systems for multistory buildings and the application of value techniques to the construction industry. The study uses data that obtained from the RSMeans Assemblies Books for the period 1997–2019. The data obtained from RSMeans consists of assembly cost ($/sf of floor) as the dependent variable; and the structural span (ft.), superimposed load (p.s.f), unit cost of sheet metal ($/LF of sheet), unit cost of concrete ($/CY), unit cost of steel structural ($/ton), and total load (p.s.f) as the independent variables. A simple computer model is designed for recommending the optimal composite flooring system of a multistory building, during the preliminary design stage.

More specifically, this study intends to (1) identify the green cost surcharge difference on a global scale; (2) identify the green cost surcharge differences across building types; and (3) gain a basic understanding of the causes of cost differences. A literature survey on green building surcharge costs was performed, resulting in a total of more than 1,300 cases from 11 countries. The cases included both residential and nonresidential units. The results show that there is a regional difference among green cost surcharges; however, the median and mean green cost surcharges are 7%. Furthermore, there is a cost difference among building types, with school buildings having the highest cost surcharge. Varied cost estimation and collection methods also lead to different green cost surcharge results; the differences between industry findings and academic research are very apparent.

In the case when the soil nailing system alone is not feasible, then other types of retaining walls can be used together. Therefore, this paper aimed to assess combination soil nailing and crib wall in terms of cost benefits. Analysis of cost comparison from cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was carried out between soil nailing and crib wall as a reference. Common problems of soil nailing such as rebar encroaching to neighbouring land were solved by using a crib wall because it can be constructed on a small space. This type of combination is known as a combined system retaining structure. Design and construction data have been collected from a project under construction in Selangor. The results of CBA proved that the construction should proceed with the combined system when the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is greater than 1 and the net present value (NPV) is greater than 0. When NPV and BCR are used to determine the CBA, there is an economic validation to further the project if NPV and BCR are equal to 0 that shows the breakeven point (less certain outcome). However, if BCR is less than 0, then the project should not proceed with the selected method. The findings suggest that a comparison of the cost estimation could verify the future feasibility of the proposed method. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021"

Cost overruns in highway projects have been a universal occurrence that jeopardize the development, maintenance, and expansion of this vital infrastructure. Incorrect cost estimations can drive decision makers to pass ineffective policies that have played a large role in the cost overruns of transportation construction projects. The existing prediction models in the literature are limited in one or multiple areas of modeling approach, inputs, and model development robustness. In this research, a model was developed to accurately predict the total construction cost of highway projects by utilizing machine learning algorithms. This study developed a modeling pipeline to automate much of the cost forecasting process, reducing the amount of manual work and dependence on skilled data scientists. This study used the Florida Department of Transportation's (FDOT's) critical highway construction cost items between 2001 and 2017 to test the model. The highways of Florida were selected for testing due to the states' population growth, high immigrant population, logistics, and hurricane frequency. This study used a pool of five categories of independent variables (69 variables total), including the construction market, energy market, socioeconomics, US economy, and temporal variables, which were compiled from relevant sources and existing literature. The results revealed that our linear model exhibits superiority in generalization and prediction of cost items over nonlinear models and is capable of accurately forecasting highway construction costs. Our suggested approach in this study also provides more accurate forecasts for the detailed cost estimation by considering the monthly historical information for the average 92.6% of the six highway construction types mentioned with a 92.51% prediction accuracy. By employing our developed model, local governments, network operators, contractors, and logistics sectors would be capable of a more exact prediction of highway construction costs.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Capital cost during initial cost estimation of chemical plants strongly depends on the installation factor(s) of the methodology employed. How these installation factors respond to the cost of each equipment determines the total plant cost and the type of capital cost (new plant or modification project) each method is suited for. The effect of equipment installation factors on capital cost of an amine-based CO2 capture plant using the Enhanced Detailed Factor (EDF) method has been studied. Plant construction characteristic factors have also been introduced to account for different plant construction characteristic situations. The impacts of the installation factors of seven methodologies on capital cost were compared. A uniform installation factor will likely lead to overestimation of very expensive equipment and underestimation of less expensive equipment. EDF method's installation factors respond based on each equipment cost. Even though all the methods estimated the optimum ΔTmin in the cross-exchanger to be 15°C, the cost estimated was €66/tCO2 by the EDF method, Smith's percentage of delivered-equipment factorial method and Hand's factorial method; and €69–79/tCO2 by the other methods. The results demonstrate that the EDF method is suitable for estimating capital cost for new plants and modification projects, small and large plants, and accounts for different plants’ situations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The reason for this is that after the planning, the most important issue is the cost of the investment. There are many different estimation methods. These estimates may vary in depth, depending on the task and the plan. The question is what happens if we wanted to predict not only the total cost of the investment but also the cost of some parts and structures. Such a cost element is the formwork cost of the monolithic reinforced concrete structures. This is a special processing aid, which makes it difficult to calculate accurately. The study is based on a cost analysis of the construction of 22 completed buildings over the last 10 years. Here, the cost of the formwork was compared to the total cost of the construction. By examining the 22 buildings together, we made findings over the years. We wanted to find out how much the construction price changes affected the structure and the formwork costs.

Early decisions based on an estimate involve highly uncertain subsequent disputes between stakeholders.

Thus, this research identified seven ADVs with 40 design options that have conflicting contributions to the cost performance in construction. These options were quantitatively evaluated and combined to generate the cost of potential designs. Based on that, a novel Architectural-Based Construction Cost Impact Scoring System (ACCISS) was developed to reduce stakeholders’ subjectivity, and accordingly, determine the most appropriate design decision that provides early cost advice and highlights the most cost-acceptable design alternatives. The proposed ACCISS is capable to automatically evaluate any combination of design alternatives, through its simple and user-friendly program.

The study used rubber waste powder as partial replacement to ordinary bitumen by 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of its weight and, with adequate samples, properties of the bitumen product were investigated, after checking the standard quality of used bitumen 60/70 grade. It was established that more adequate results were achieved at 5% of replacement, which showed the penetration value of 61.66 tenths mm, the softening point value of 52.750C, and the viscosity of 134 sec. Regarding the cost estimation of this new bitumen, a cost reduction of around 5.3% was realized.

One of the main parameters that helps owners in making better decisions in designing their buildings is to look after the cost perspective on different design scenarios. Thus, this study aims to propose a semi-automated BIM-based cost estimation approach that enables practitioners to estimate the cost of projects based on different design scenarios by an accurate and agile system. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes an integrated framework, through which the cost estimation standard of Iran (FehrestBaha) is linked to the materials quantity take-offs (QTO) from BIM models. The performance of the system is based on connecting the classification standards of UniFormat and MasterFormat to the cost estimation standard of FehrestBaha. A BIM-based extension in the Revit environment is developed to automate the cost estimation process. Findings: To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach in cost estimation, it is implemented to estimate the cost of the architectural discipline in a real construction project. The results indicate that the proposed BIM-based approach estimated the cost of the architectural discipline with an acceptable level of accuracy. Practical implications: The proposed approach could be used by practitioners to have an agile and accurate BIM-based cost estimation of different scenarios during design process. The semi-automated system considerably reduces the time of cost estimation in comparison to the traditional manual approaches, particularly in complex structures. Owners are able to easily trace changes in project cost according to any changes in components and materials of the BIM model. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides a practical roadmap for BIM-based cost estimation based on cost estimation standards in different countries. Originality/value: Unlike the traditional manual cost estimation approaches, the proposed BIM-based approach is not highly dependent on the knowledge of experienced estimators, which therefore facilitates its implementation. Furthermore, automating both QTO process and the required calculations in this approach increases the accuracy of cost estimation while decreasing the probability of human errors or omission occurrence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It is not uncommon that states' DOT estimates (owner's estimates) are significantly different from contractors' submitted bids. This is a critical problem for state highway agencies that strive to develop more accurate cost estimates, deliver projects within the budget, and optimize constrained funds for their highway programs. This inaccuracy problem is a temporal issue since the engineer's estimate is developed ahead of time before the project is advertised and bids are received. The question that transportation agencies are interested in finding an answer to is: are there any significant risk factors in the construction market indicating to the increased likelihood of the deviation between owner's estimate and the submitted low bid? In this research, a temporal perspective is selected to answer this question through identifying risk factors affecting the accuracy of the owner's estimate. The ratio of low bid to owner's estimate is examined using time-series analysis. The objectives of this research are to (1) examine several variables representing local highway construction market, overall construction market, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market, to identify the leading indicators of ratio of low bid to owner's estimate; and (2) use the identified leading indicators to develop an appropriate time-series model to forecast the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate. Four variables are identified as the major leading indicators: (1) number of projects awarded in the same month at the state level; (2) average number of bidders last month; (3) producer price index for steel mill products (PPISM); and (4) construction cost index (CCI). Several seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variable (ARIMAX) models are developed that are capable of forecasting the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate with a high accuracy. This research contributes to the state of knowledge of analyzing the difference between owner's estimate and low bid through: (1) identification of leading indicators of ratio of low bid to owner's estimate that convey the extent of risk and uncertainty associated with construction projects at the cost estimation phase; and (2) development of appropriate multivariate time-series models (i.e., ARIMAX models) to predict the ratio of low bid to owner's estimate. It is anticipated that the results will help cost estimating professionals in transportation agencies better understand the variability between their estimates and submitted bids by highway contractors, and thus, prepare more accurate cost estimates and develop appropriate risk management strategies for enhanced decision-making. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

It can mitigate the volume expansion problem encountered by the sulfur cathode, in addition, as a fully lithium-inserted cathode, it can be paired with lithium-free anodes or be assembled into anode-free batteries. However, commercially available Li2S powder delivers poor electrochemical performances due to the significant potential barrier during the first charging process, and therefore developing inexpensive synthesis route for nanosized Li2S with small diameter and low charging overpotential becomes the key to the construction of practical Li2S cathode. Herein, the preparation methods for Li2S nanoparticles are summarized, including laboratory synthesis methods and potential large-scale preparation routes; traditional industrial synthesis methods for commercially available Li2S are also attached as references. In particular, the scalability of these methods is mentioned, and the costs of the resulted Li2S products are also estimated and compared with the currently used cathode materials for Li-ion batteries.

In the process of XPath query, there is inherent seriality between query steps, which makes it difficult to parallelize the query effectively as a whole. On the other hand, although XPath query has the characteristics of data stream processing and is suitable for pipeline processing, the data flow of each query step usually varies a lot, which results in limited performance under multithreading conditions. In this paper, we propose a pipelined XPath query method (PXQ) based on cost optimization. This method uses pipelined query primitives to process query steps based on relation index. During pipeline construction, a cost estimation model based on XML statistics is proposed to estimate the cost of the query primitive and provide guidance for the creation of a pipeline phase through the partition of query primitive sequence. The pipeline construction technique makes full use of available worker threads and optimizes the load balance between pipeline stages. The experimental results show that our method can adapt to the multithreaded environment and stream processing scenarios of XPath query, and its performance is better than the existing typical query methods based on data parallelism.  © 2021 Rongxin Chen et al."

However, it affects the efficiency of operations as these customizations are based on uniqueness. In this study, we analyzed the impact of customized modules and processing time on customer service request (CSR), by utilizing the stacked CSR data during the construction and operation of ERP, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As a result, a positive correlation was found between unit companies and the length of ERP implementation; ERP modules and the length of ERP implementation; ERP modules and unit companies; and the type of ERP implementation and ERP module. In terms of CSR, a comparison of CSR processing time of CBO (customized business object) module and STD (standard) module revealed that while the five modules did not display statistically significant differences, one module demonstrated a statistically very significant difference. In sum, the analysis indicates that the CBO-type CSR and its processing cost are higher than those of STD-type CSR. These results indicate that companies planning to implement an ERP system should consider the ERP module and their customization ratio and level. It not only gives the theoretical validity that should be considered as an indicator for decision making when ERP is constructed, but also its implications on the impact of processing time suggesting that the maintenance costs and project scheduling of ERP software must also be considered.

Construction delays have become typical of many construction projects leading to lawsuits, project termination, and ultimately dissatisfied stakeholders. Experts have highlighted the lack of adoption of modern technologies as a cause of underproductivity. Nevertheless, the construction industry has an opportunity to tackle many of its woes through Construction 4.0, driven by enabling digital technologies such as machine learning. Consequently, this paper describes a framework based on the application of machine learning for delay mitigation in construction projects. The key areas identified for machine learning application include ""cost estimation"", ""duration estimation"", and ""delay risk assessment"". The developed framework is based on the CRISP-DM graphical framework. Relevant data were obtained to implement the framework in the three key areas identified, and satisfactory results were obtained. The machine learning methods considered include Multi Linear Regression Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Ensemble methods. Finally, interviews with professional experts were carried out to validate the developed framework in terms of its applicability, appropriateness, practicality, and reliability. The main contribution of this research is in its conceptualization and validation of a framework as a problem-solving strategy to mitigate construction delays. The study emphasized the cross-disciplinary campaign of the modern construction industry and the potential of machine learning in solving construction problems. COPYRIGHT: © 2021 The author(s).

This Application Case within WP15 of the HOLISHIP project refers to the conceptual design of an offshore foundation concept to manage both wave and ice loads in shallow waters with soft bottom seabed. Specifically, this chapter outlines the concept design, the structural analysis, and early project cost estimates of the construction, transportation and on-site installation. The adopted approach is holistic by looking into all main issues of the platform design, of construction installation and life-cycle cost. The application area selected for this study is the Northeast Caspian Sea. However, the concept is also well suited for other regions of the world with similar conditions. The concept can be used in hydrocarbon field development, bridge piers, oil piers (offshore loading facilities), wind turbine foundations, channel markers, lighthouse foundations, dolphins and harbour berth wall structures. In the concept development work, basic structural assessment and cost estimation tools and models have been developed. They have been integrated into the HOLISHIP concept design platform based on CAESES® enabling the iterative or optimisation designs in future feasibility studies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."

Four different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), namely anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A2O), membrane bioreactor (MBR), moving bed bioreactor (MBBR), and integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) were simulated regarding the daily annual data obtained from a meat processing unit. The descending order concerning the total cost (TC) was as follows: MBR > A2O > IFAS > MBBR while it was as MBR > IFAS > MBBR > A2O based on RE. Regarding the energy and material consumption costs, the A2O and MBR were the highest and lowest cost-effective systems, respectively. However, the MBR was the best from a biological treatment cost perspective. The boilers and co-generators contributed to 75% and 25% of the produced biogas, respectively, that supplied 50% of WWTP electricity demand. Among all different influent parameters, the effect of flow rate, COD, and BOD on the TC was statistically significant. Furthermore, the TC and present worth illustrated the most sensitivity to the construction cost alteration.

This requires an accurate post-earthquake cost estimation tool. Currently, there are no post-earthquake loss estimation models to estimate repair costs accurately. There are loss assessment tools available, namely, HAZUS, performance assessment calculation tool (PACT), seismic performance and loss assessment tool (SLAT) and seismic performance prediction tool, which have not been specifically used for post-earthquake repair cost estimation. This paper aims to focus on identifying factors that need to be considered when upgrading these tools for post-earthquake repair cost estimation. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted as an exploratory study using a literature review, document analysis of the PACT, SLAT and HAZUS software and 18 semi-structured interviews. Findings: The research identified information sources available for estimation and factors to be considered when developing estimations based on the information sources. Research limitations/implications: The data was collected from professionals who were involved mostly in housing repair work in New Zealand. Therefore, impact of these repair work factors might vary in other forms of structures such as civil structures include bridges and the country as a result of varying construction details and standards. Practical implications: The identified factors will be used to improve the loss estimation tools are such as PACT and HAZUS, as well as to develop a post-earthquake repair cost estimation tool. Originality/value: Currently, the identified factors impacting post-earthquake damage repair cost estimations are not considered in loss estimation tools.

Currently, most investment estimation researches render the point value results, which could lead to considerable uncertainty in the estimation results and increase the risk of decision-making. Therefore, it is essential to explore a type of systematic, accurate, and effective estimation method. This study proposed an innovative estimation method of probability interval prediction based on the distribution of prediction errors. First, the dimension reduction of the construction indexes was conducted by using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Then, a model was developed based on the fusion of the support vector regression (SVR) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Finally, cost intervals with different confidence levels were obtained on the basis of kernel density estimation (KDE). The case results indicated that when the confidence was 95%, the comprehensive evaluation index coverage width-based criterion (CWC) and the interval coverage rate PICC of the cost estimation were 2.17 and 93.33%, respectively. Hence, the proposed interval prediction model was fairly reliable, which could provide practical guidance for the investment decisions in the early stage of construction projects and give the decision makers more abundant forecasting information.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Significant depletion in the natural resources has led to the scarcity of river sand as well. On the contrary, there has been an ever-increasing demand on supply of these key construction materials due to rapid urbanization across the world. This has envisaged the development of many alternatives to conventional construction materials. Interlocking block masonry units (IBM) and stabilized earth block masonry units (SEB) are one such alternatives which have been explored from quite some time. There are enough evidences on the rise of buildings constructed using these masonry units in the construction industry. The reasons for its popularity are due to the aesthetic appearance and affordability. Although there has been literature reported on the studies of IBM and SEB [1–4], there is a need to revisit the behavior of these masonry units due to its wide usage in the construction industry. Hence in this study, experimental and analytical investigations have been carried out to compare the compressive strength between interlocking block masonry (IBM) and stabilized earth block masonry (SEB). Finite element model (FEM) for IBM and SEB has been created using the concrete damage plasticity model to simulate the inelastic material behavior. Analysis is carried out for prisms and walls under axial compression and cost estimation for construction of wall is conducted. The results indicate that interlocking block prisms without mortar joint has lower load-bearing capacity as compared to stabilized earth blocks with mortar joint. IBM is more cost effective to construct than SEB wall. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

It is important to utilize the knowledge gained from past projects and historical cost data to predict a new project’s cost. Therefore, this research tries to develop a new methodology based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) for improving the accuracy and efficiency of prediction on a residential project’s total construction cost and its main component costs including engineering project cost, installation project cost and decoration project cost. In this research, we constructed 15 attributes that correspond with the project characteristics and market price fluctuations, and developed 4 SVR models to predict the residential project’s costs. To verify the prediction performance of the proposed model, a case study was performed on 84 residential projects in Chongqing, China. BP Neural Network (BPNN) and Random Forest (RF) were also used to compare the accuracy and stability of prediction results. The results show that the suggested SVR models achieve higher accuracy with 98.32% of the overall cost estimation compared with other models. This research shows that the developed model is effective in early decision making and cost management since the construction cost and its component cost can be predicted accurately before the completion of a project’s design stage. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."

In line with the fourth industrial revolution, the demand for engineering project management solutions to apply artificial intelligence (AI) in big data technology is increasing. The purpose of this study was to predict the risk of contractor and support decision-making at each project stage using machine-learning (ML) technology based on data generated in the bidding, engineering, construction, and OM stages of EPC projects. As a result of this study, the Engineering Machine-learning Automation Platform (EMAP), a cloud-based integrated analysis tool applied with big data and AI/ML technology, was developed. EMAP is an intelligent decision support system that consists of five modules: Invitation to Bid (ITB) Analysis, Design Cost Estimation, Design Error Checking, Change Order Forecasting, and Equipment Predictive Maintenance, using advanced AI/ML algorithms. In addition, each module was validated through case studies to assure the performance and accuracy of the module. This study contributes to the strengthening of the risk response for each stage of the EPC project, especially preventing errors by the project managers, and improving their work accuracy.

Some model parameters, such as the number of competitors and the project's cost, are estimated by analyzing historical data. Then, a mathematical model for the bidding price decision that maximizes the expected profit is proposed. To reduce the risk of suffering from a large loss, a maximum acceptable risk constraint is employed. To evaluate the model's performance, some numerical problems are examined. Moreover, sensitivity analysis of the key parameters and a robustness evaluation of the model against uncertain parameters are conducted. To evaluate the model's effectiveness in real-world situations, a case study is analyzed using the proposed approach. The numerical results indicate that the proposed approach reduces the cost estimation errors and increases the average expected profit, which validates the applicability of the model.

Numerous factors influence the tunnel construction cost, and very little information on these factors is available at the early stage of project planning. Developing an accurate cost estimate is therefore very difficult at this stage, and thus, a very limited number of cost models are available for this purpose. This paper develops early parametric cost estimating models for road and railway tunnels in the planning stage of a project based upon the application of multiple regression analysis on 25 constructed projects located in Western European countries. The developed models incorporate not only tunnel length and diameter but also the type of tunneling methods (mechanized and conventional), which are largely affected by geological conditions. The results showed high correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.968 and 0.79 for mechanized and conventional tunneling models respectively. In addition, the results of the developed models were compared against actual costs to assess their accuracy and robustness.

In view of the high nonlinearity, fuzziness and complexity of TBM excavation process, and in order to improve the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) has been applied to extract the principal components of the influencing parameters. Then the deep neural network (DNN) is employed to train and forecast the TBM penetration rate. A prediction model of TBM penetration rate based on the coupled method of PLSR and DNN is proposed. Based on the measured data of the double-shield TBM construction of a water conveyance tunnel in the Lanzhou water source construction project, six impact parameters including the rock uniaxial compressive strength, rock uniaxial tensile strength, cutter head thrust, cutter head speed, rock mass integrity coefficient and rock Cerchar abrasiveness index are selected to verify the prediction reasonability of the model. The fitting and prediction accuracy of the different prediction methods are compared and analyzed. The research results show that the PLSR can effectively overcome the problem of multiple collinearity between the independent variables. The extracted principal components are trained as the input layer of the DNN, which simplifies the structure of the neural network. The PLSR-DNN coupled model effectively avoids the over-fitting and inadequate fitting problems. It has the characteristics of fast convergence, stable solution and high fitting accuracy. The average relative fitting error of the PLSR-DNN prediction model is 2.96%, and the average relative prediction error is 3.27%. The fitting accuracy and prediction accuracy of the PLSR-DNN prediction model is significantly higher than those of PLSR model alone, BP neural network model and SVR model, respectively. © 2021, Science Press.

However, conventional BIM models do not contain all the necessary information for QTO, and the calculation does not follow the descriptive rules in standard method of measurement (SMM), which impact the cost estimation accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a new data model and knowledge-based system to incorporate the required SMM rules, which greatly facilitates BIM software in automatic and accurate QTO. The proposed new methods involve the development of a generic data model by identifying and incorporating the required information (e.g., geometry, semantics) in SMM. Following this, information checking algorithms are developed to check the information completeness and textural errors in QTO practices. Furthermore, the descriptive rules in SMM are defined to create a knowledge library that guides the BIM software in performing automatic QTO. Results of illustrative examples indicate that the proposed new methods can accurately compute the quantities of building components in compliant with SMM, regardless of different approaches for model creation. The proposed methods also linguistically identify the textural errors of parameters and check the compliance of descriptive rules for better QTO practices.

The unstructured nature of the construction data presents challenges for its management. The different user habits, time-consuming system operation, and long pretraining time all make the data management system full of data in an inconsistent format or even incorrect data. Processing the construction data into a machine-readable format is not only time-consuming but also labor-intensive. Therefore, this study used Taiwan’s public construction data as an example case to develop a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning-based text classification system, coined as automatic correction system (ACS). The developed system is designed to automatically correct the public construction data, meanwhile improving the efficiency of manual data correction. The ACS has two main features: data correction that converts unstructured data into structured data; a recommendation function that provides users with a recommendation list for manual data correction. For implementation, the developed system was used to correct the data in the public construction cost estimation system (PCCES) in Taiwan.

The strategic value of transportation systems along the rivers is still fundamental for commercial, emergency, and touristic purposes. These are highly exposed to the erosion effect of the rivers and climate change. The Brescia-Parma railway is a railway line between Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions in Italy. After the town of Casalmaggiore, the railway line crosses the Po river with a steel bridge (from ch. 20+750 to ch. 21+855) on 16 piles of which 4 on the riverbed and 12 on the floodplain (Work Package 1). The piles on the river undergo a severe erosion phenomenon with a documented evolution from 1992. To assess the characteristics of the riverbed with a centimetric precision, ETS Srl has implemented and deployed a marine Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for the bathymetric survey of 35000 sqm in two days. The optimized dimension of the vehicle and the cutting-edge multibeam echosounder allow the seabed mapping even in sheltered and complex contexts. The post-processed survey is automatically implemented in the software GeoHECRAS to refine lidar and open DTM data for the hydraulic modelling. Other interferences, such as the near road bridge SP343R, were drawn directly in the software. A hydrologic analysis was carried to obtain the hydrograph laws and bi-dimensional modelling (Unsteady model) was implement in GeoHECRAS. The analysis allows a comprehensive and extensive understanding of the flood evolution and erosion effects for different return periods. For the mitigation of the erosion near the piles, an intervention with sack gabions was designed following the morphology from the high precision bathymetric survey and the results of the analysis. Thanks to such data, detailed quantity take-off, and cost estimation were possible even in the early stage of the design. Nowadays, in most cases, this operation is not possible even in the design for the construction stage. From the results of the analysis, the flood development involves also the station of Mezzano Rondani (ch. 19+681) which corresponds to the right main levee of the Po river. In fact, the railway is a discontinuity of the levee. The design included a horizontal steel bulkhead with mechanical apparatus to be activated during flood events in order to close the levee and guarantee the safety of the station and the nearby urban area (Work Package 2). The design of the closing system included the reshaping of the levees, the structures, and the resolution of the station interferences. The design analyses with the aforementioned interventions show the effectiveness of the proposed solution to guarantee safety during flood events of the Po River in the area crossing the Brescia-Parma railway. © 2022 IAHR."

Recent developments in the field rely on complicated procedures that necessitate the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM), coding procedures, and advanced cost estimation approaches. The field requires simple theoretically-sound procedures that are easy to adopt and BIM-compatible. This study sought to address this requirement by offering an innovative framework, workflow, and logical operation for cash flow management with BIM. The proposed framework is capable of: (1) accurately estimating the cash flow of projects, taking account of payment patterns for materials, equipment, human resources, and sub-contractors, as well as contract-related attributes and (2) assessing the impacts of important risk factors on the cash flow of projects. In methodological terms, the procedure followed by the study is to develop a proof of concept (PoC). A case project in Iran is used to validate the proposed framework and to assess its practicability in real-life contexts. The study would appeal to researchers by providing the theoretical foundations and logical procedures for a BIM-enabled framework and extending the body of knowledge on cash flow management of construction projects.

Although some of these processes have been automated, construction cost estimation still relies heavily on manual inputs. To compute a cost estimate, an estimator needs to: (1) take off quantities and extract some required cost information from the architectural model or drawing; (2) extract other required cost information from the construction specifications; (3) assign building elements to work or cost items; and (4) retrieve the unit cost of the work or cost items to further compute the cost estimate. To achieve full automation of construction cost estimation, the manual inputs required to classify building elements, and to retrieve pricing information of work items need to be automated. To address that, the authors proposed a new method that uses semantic modeling and natural language processing techniques in developing algorithms that automate the manual processes involved in: (1) extracting design information from construction specifications; (2) using the extracted information to match specified material in the construction specifications with items from an established database; and (3) retrieving the pricing information of the materials specified in the construction specifications. To test the validity of the authors' proposed method, an experiment was conducted using eight wood construction projects in Detroit, MI. The proposed method was utilized to develop an algorithm that can process the construction specifications automatically and retrieve the unit cost of materials from a database. The results from the developed algorithm were compared with the gold standard (results manually generated by industry experts). The developed algorithms achieved 99.2% precision and 99.2% recall (i.e., 99.2% F1-measure) for extracted design information instances; 100% precision and 96.5% recall (i.e., 98.2% F1-measure) for extracted materials from the database. The authors demonstrated that as the training data increases, the performance levels increase. The developed algorithms utilized 5.56% of the time it took using the current traditional method of extracting design information from construction specifications manually. These results showed that the proposed method is promising in developing algorithms that automate the processing of construction specifications to extract the design related information in fulfilling essential information requirements of detailed wood construction cost estimation and in retrieving the unit costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Consequently, the cost performance of a project may be entirely distinct for the owner and the contractor. Since the majority of quantitative research on cost estimation and deviation found in the literature adopts the owners’ perspective, this research provides a contribution towards modeling costs and cost deviation from a contractor’s perspective. From an initial sample of 13 residential buildings and 10 office building projects, it was possible to develop models for cost estimation at the early stage of development, including both endogenous and exogenous variables. Although the sample is relatively small, the authors were able to fully analyze all the cost data, using no secondary sources of data (which is very frequent in cost modeling studies). The statistically significant variables in the cost estimation models were the areas above and below ground and the years following the 2008 financial crisis, including the international bailout (2011–2014) period. For estimating the unit cost, a nonlinear model was obtained with the number of underground and total floor, the floor ratio, and the years following the 2008 financial crisis, including the international bailout (2011–2014) period as predictors. For the office buildings, a statistically significant correlation was also found between the cost deviation and number of underground floors. © 2021 by the authors.

The detailed estimation process and methodology for using standard unit price information was also developed to strengthen cost information interoperability by utilizing standard classification systems, such as MasterFormat, UniFormat, UniClass, and ISO 12006. This concept may be proposed as a method of connecting construction information based on a standard cost classification system in order to improve estimation efficiency by increasing the connectivity of cost information. Ontology can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with interoperability to manage the massive volume of construction information for cost management. This methodology can expand to integrated management in cost and time to derive additional classes for work breakdown structure (WBS).

Recovery of the unrecoverable low-pressure gas has been unsolved since then. Regarding lower gas nomination forecasted and exported condensate rate in low condensate production mode, LP flare rate is being simulated at 1-3 MMSCFD whilst the existing condensate and gas recovery system shows the available capacity left over even the field potential is maintained. This information energized the opportunity of Recovery Scheme by boosting the pressure of LP Flare Gas and feeding the recovered gas to the existing FGRU compressor within the minimal modification scope. Entire feasible recovery options had been technically examined including essential requirements of modification to evaluate the Pros and Cons on each development scenarios. Key engineering challenge on recovery of the low-pressure heavy flare gas is the closed recirculation of recovered hydrocarbon which wastefully occupies the system capacity. Selection on the returning point of the recovered gas is crucial to minimize the recirculation while increasing production yield. The selected option provides less modification works whereas the entire recovered gas feeding back to the existing FGRU compressor is feasible while the existing facilities at its maximum capacity are utilized and new equipment installation requires only one (Wet Screw) compressor and one liquid recovery (Vertical in-line centrifugal) pump. Each equipment was technically selected through evaluated technical specifications and limitation of installation spaces. Furthermore, the installation scenarios on the aging production platform are key challenge as deck extension, which new equipment are installed, is heavy-lifted, and installed on the existing lower deck of Production Platform using the available margin of platform load on the existing piles. Cost estimation is conducted together with economic evaluation for investment decision. The project is budgetary approved providing an attractive positive NPV. The economic evaluation results in positive NPV mainly due to the condensate gain from the flare gas recovery insisting that greenhouse gas reduction project could be performed in the techno-economical way.

For this purpose, data sets from three different projects are exported from the software RIB iTWOTM and analysed with regard to process discovery. Investigations are carried out from the control flow, case and organisational perspectives. A particular problem in the analysing part is the currently inadequate quality of the data sets to be examined. Due to data quality issues the consideration of temporal aspects is rather not possible. Therefore, consistent and appropriate forms of logging must be implemented in software systems that are used to support the AECO industry. For the present use case an automated working script was created to process the log data to fix further quality issues and meet process mining requirements. The results show that it is essential to establish standardised language rules that are generally valid throughout the industry and that are subsequently referenced by all utilised software systems.

In this study, the performance of four machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), was examined in estimating SRC values. The total floor area (TFA), number of stories (NS), seismic weight (SW), seismicity (S), soil type (ST), plan configuration (PC), and structural type (STT) were considered as structural input variables. To achieve the best performance of applied MLAs, twenty-two scenarios based on different combinations of input variables were considered. The correlation coefficient (r), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Adjusted R-squared, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) metrics together with the Taylor diagram were used to compare the accuracy of applied models. A sensitivity analysis using the RReliefF algorithm showed that TFA, SW, and PC are the most influential parameters, whereas the ST and STT have negative influences on SRC values. Comparison analysis results indicated that the ELM model with r of 0.896, RMSE of 0.081, and NSE of 0.758 had the best performance among other employed MLAs. Also, the RF regression achieved the second rank. In conclusion, the ELM model with single-layer feedforward neural network was superior to other data-driven models; therefore, it can be applied as an efficient tool for estimating SRC values using structural input parameters. © 2021 The Authors.

Often stakeholders will have to prioritize the economic and environmental indicators based on the project objectives. The study presents a methodological framework to compare economic and environmental impacts to benchmark sustainable transport construction projects. Through findings, the study aims to inform focus areas and key stages of infrastructure projects to benchmark sustainable performance. Process-based emission and cost estimation models are presented with an AHP based weighting factor that enables prioritization of emissions and costs based on project scopes and objectives. Using a case study, results are represented to validate the framework and methodology. Concrete and steel are identified as the main materials that contribute to total carbon emissions, while soil and gravel are responsible for the highest costs. Electricity consumption is discovered as the major fuel type contributing to carbon emissions. Concrete and dump trucks are discovered as the top two sources of emissions and costs, respectively. Scenario analyses revealed that the choice of equipment significantly affects the project’s emissions and costs. The application of sustainable materials can significantly reduce emissions and cost. The use of the case study approach results in a lack of generalizability. However, the same methodology and process can be adopted for the sustainable benchmarking of different projects. Researchers are encouraged to investigate processes to automate sustainable benchmarking of transport infrastructure construction projects. The study is one of the first attempts to compare cost and environmental impacts using a systematic methodology of transportation infrastructure construction projects. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, the collection of raw materials for its production can provide added benefits such as reduction of wildfire risk, additional income for farmers, and decreased disposal costs. Although there is substantial literature on design and modeling of supply chains, the authors were unable to find a single reference with the information needed for the selection and cost estimation of each type of equipment involved in the supply chain. Therefore, the goal of this research is to gather information necessary for the construction and utilization of models that might drive the identification of a feasible supply chain to produce renewable fuels at a commercial scale. The primary objectives are to 1) understand the supply chain of critical feedstocks for renewable fuels production; 2) identify the equipment commercially available for collection and adequation of feedstock; and 3) consolidate information regarding equipment cost, energy consumption, and efficiency, as well as feedstock storage and transportation systems. This paper provides a compilation for five feedstock types studied for sustainable aviation fuel production: 1) agricultural residues and grasses, 2) forest residues, 3) urban wood waste, 4) oilseeds, 5) fats, oils & greases.

The commercially proven post combustion capture process, monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent based scrubbing, was designed with the help of Aspen Plus to determine the size of scrubbing towers, accessory equipment's and the utilities for capturing 90% of CO2 from the flue gas. The flue gas stream data was obtained from a local cement industry. Our analysis showed that absorber and stripper columns of 10 m and 7 m packing height respectively are required to capture approximately 250 Ktons/year of CO2. The columns will have packing diameters of 6 m and 4 m respectively. The total capital cost and the production cost for the plant of this scale was calculated to be $10 million and $21 million respectively. The bulk of the total production cost, $18 million per year, was the utility (electricity) cost for regenerating the solvent. The profitability of the capture plant was found to be highly sensitive to the electricity cost which presents a huge opportunity for Nepal. Based on our estimate, the total cost per kg of CO2 capture in Nepal will be about $0.086. A 30% lower electricity cost would lower the capture cost to $0.063/kg CO2. The availability of cheap hydropower electricity (lower than $0.01/kWh) makes CO2 capture based urea manufacturing process to be a viable alternative for Nepal. We hope this economic evaluation data will serve as the baseline for the policy makers to undertake a more detailed study on the carbon capture and electrolysis based urea manufacturing plant in the country. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The construction of forest roads requires tremendous capital outlays and usually constitutes a major component of the construction industry. The availability of cost estimation models assisting in the early stages of a project would therefore be of great help for timely costing of alternatives and more economical solutions. This study describes the development and application of such cost estimation models. First, the main cost elements and variables affecting total construction costs were determined for which the real-world data were derived from the project bids and an analysis of 300 segments of a three kilometer road constructed in the Hyrcanian Forests of Iran. Then, five state-of-the-art machine learning methods, i.e., linear regression (LR), K-Star, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and Instance-based learning (IBL) were applied to develop models that would estimate construction costs from the real-world data. The performance of the models was measured using the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent of relative error index (PREI). The results showed that the IBL model had the highest training performance (R = 0.998, RMSE = 1.4%), whereas the SVM model had the highest estimation capability (R = 0.993, RMSE = 2.44%). PREI indicated that all models but IBL (mean PREI = 0.0021%) slightly underestimated the construction costs. Despite these few differences, the results demonstrated that the cost estimations developed here were consistent with the project bids, and our models thus can serve as a guideline for better allocating financial resources in the early stages of the bidding process. © 2021 by the authors.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides an opportunity to utilize its database to develop a reliable cost estimate. The existing BIM-Based cost estimate tools rely on quantity extraction of design elements, then apply the cost. This practice has two limitations, first, it diminishes the spatial context of BIM elements, and second, the associated costs are derived from pricing the quantities, not the work items associated with BIM elements. This paper proposes a system to develop a cost estimate for building projects using a Structured Query Language (SQL). The approach leverages SQL to create an interoperable information management system that effectively transacts data with BIM elements. The proposed system harnesses BIM element parameters to drive work items associated with the parameter’s host element. The system applicability is illustrated by developing a cost estimate of a BIM element using the extracted quantities, work items, and methods of construction. The BIM-based cost estimate is compared with a manually prepared cost estimate for the same element.

These models characterize the relationship between average hourly earnings and a set of explanatory variables. The framework is applied to develop VEC forecasting models for the average hourly earnings of construction labor in the USA based on the identified variables that govern its movements, such as Global Energy Price Index, Gross Domestic Product, and Personal Consumption Expenditures. More than 150 candidate VEC models were created, of which 25 passed the diagnostics. The most appropriate model was then identified by comparing the prediction performance of these models when applied to the forecasting average hourly earnings over 36-months. The proposed framework and the ensuing models address the need for appropriate models that can forecast the short- and long-run movements of the labor costs. Practitioners can use the proposed framework to develop much-needed forecast models and estimate construction labor costs of the various projects. The insights derived from the development and applications of these models can enhance the chances of project success. © 2021, Korean Society of Civil Engineers."

This technology has been recently implemented to estimate the costs of several transportation projects, but there is not a tool that accurately estimates the cost in a continuous spectrum and keeps pace with the progress of the transportation project. The main objectives of this study were to (1) create a cost estimation mechanism that operates in a continuous spectrum from the study phase to the construction phase of transportation projects, and (2) automate the cost estimation process. Open standards such as the industry foundation classes (IFC) were used, and the level of confidence (LOC) mechanism were introduced and implemented for determining the risk of the estimated costs. The developed cost estimation approach will be implemented as a web-based application developed by C# and ASP.NET MVC Core. The results of implementing this tool showed that a higher LOD level results in greater reliability in the cost estimation and quantity take-off, and will help transportation project managers accurately estimate project costs throughout the construction process. © ASCE"

In a construction project, this task is essential for accurate preliminary cost estimations, investment analysis, cost and resource planning, and control and supporting decision-making processes. The BIM methodology is progressively being implemented in Construction, bringing recognized benefits in the quality of the final product and in the efficiency of the design and construction processes. As BIM is based in the generation and updating of a centralized model, containing all the information of the construction project, it presents a valid alternative to the traditional process, allowing consistent results concerning the QTO activity and facilitating the information management in construction. However, the implementation of BIM in QTO processes, by a majority, is still hindered by the lack of BIM-based measurement rules and is thus often looked upon with reservations in the industry. This paper aims to contribute to the knowledge and dissemination of the benefits of using BIM as a tool for automated QTO.

In this study, negative social impacts associated with construction projects are investigated considering different stakeholder categories and detailed social cost models. The social impacts and costs estimated in this paper cover a multitude of adverse effects on: (a) workplace and traffic safety, (b) mobility of people and goods, (c) regional economic growth, (d) dwelling environments, and (e) public services. Parameters for the social cost estimation are obtained based mainly on various public databases and project information.

The deadlines are mostly based on estimations done in front-end project development when limited data are available. Early time estimation models in literature rely on few variables and, almost in all cases, one of them is the estimated cost. Early cost estimations can significantly deviate from actual costs and thus lead to unreliable time estimation. Time estimation models based on neural network and other alternative methods require databases and software, which complicates the process of time estimation. The purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap of scarce time estimation models and unreliable time estimates by developing a new method for time estimation. This research has been done on one large sewer system project. The case study shows how to extract several continuous activities for a pipeline project chosen from a sewer system. Moreover, a new algorithm for the calculation of project duration is devised based on the existing equation related to the linear scheduling method, and this algorithm works with continuous activities. The new method for construction time estimation is based on the extraction of linear continuous activities, usage of the algorithm for identification of minimal buffer between activities, and calculation of the project duration. To verify the algorithm, this method is used on another pipeline project from a sewer system. The limitation is that this method can be used only for base estimation. Further research needs to be done to include uncertainties and risks in the method. © 2020 Burcar Dunovic et al., published by Sciendo."

In this study, the detailed description of each model and methodology are presented including facility, operations, construction matrix, post-production model, and fuel cycle cost estimation model. Based on these models, six Generation-III+ and Generation-IV nuclear reactors were simulated, namely System 80+ with benchmark data, System 80+ with uranium oxide (UOx) and mixed oxide (MOx) fuel assemblies, fast reactor, PBMR (Pebble Bed Modular Reactor), and PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor), with partially closed and benchmarked cases. The total levelized costs of these reactors were obtained, and it was observed that PBMR showed the lowest cost. The research was extended to work on the SMART reactor to calculate the total levelized fuel cycle cost, capital cost, capital component cost, fraction of capital spent, and sine curve spent pattern. To date, no work is being reported to calculate these parameters for the SMART reactor.

Analysis results indicate that the construction of a flue desulphurization system in Thermal Power Plant Pljevlja significantly reduces SO2 emissions. Increasing alternative fuels use, new generations of vehicles and electro mobility in transport measure is only one of the benefits to reduce gas emissions.

In the coverage capability evaluation model, satellite storage capacity was taken as a constraint condition, satellite working conditions were analyzed by combining with the satellite coverage geometry model, and a calculation method of coverage indexes considering satellite storage capacity was proposed. The cost of each subsystem of constellations was estimated by the small satellite cost model(SSCM). In the flexibility evaluation model, the performance loss rate was proposed, and the weight of performance loss rate was determined according to the probability function of failure states. Applying the models to the performance evaluation of SkySat and Jinlin No.1 (JL-1) constellation, the results show that SkySat constellation has stronger coverage ability, lower cost and poorer flexibility than those in JL-1.

Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Confirmatory interviews and case study comparisons were used to confirm the statistical analysis results. Findings: The results of this study indicated that each design stage’s cost estimate was affected by several factors. Two significant factors were common across four of the five design stages: client experience and project team experience.

It is demonstrated that the applicable guidelines do not consider all the actual problems encountered in designing stacks for TPSs, such as optimization of the stack construction cost and its effective operation. The stack cost depends on its height and diameter, which, at a given connected capacity, are affected by the gas velocity in the stack channel. At present, the effective stack design procedures do not contain the notion of this economically feasible, cost-effective index, and the stack diameter is selected based on the engineering-and-cost estimation calculation procedures, which have not been approved as mandatory standards. These procedures are supported by the planning-and-distribution model of the country’s economic development. The article announces a universal method developed by the authors for calculating the optimal flue gas velocity for any model of economic development irrespective of the trend in prices and expenditures for the production of goods and services. To calculate the optimal flue gas velocity, one should only input initial data valid at the present stage. The calculated results of the price factors' effect on the optimal flue gas velocity for single-flue and multiple-flue stacks are presented. Verification of the procedure against the initial data as of 1975 yields acceptable results. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc."

Its applications to life cycle management of buildings and infrastructures can further increase the social and economic benefits. As a complete information model, a digital twin integrates the information of a project from different stages of the life cycle into a model, in order to facilitate better asset management and communicate through data visualizations with participants. This paper unprecedently introduces a digital-twin aided life cycle assessment to evaluate a subway station. Dadongmen subway station in Hefei was used as a case study. This new study benchmarks the cost estimation and carbon emission at each life cycle stage of the project. The cost in the construction stage of the project is the highest, accounting for 78% of the total cost. However, the amount of carbon emissions in the operation and maintenance is higher than the amount during the production of building materials, accounting for 67%. Among them, concrete only accounts for 43.66% of the carbon emissions of building materials, even though concrete was mainly used for constructing the metro station. Steel bar and aluminum alloy have carbon emissions of 29.73% and 17.64%, respectively. In addition, emerging risks of the subway stations can be identified. The digital twin has been used to illustrate vulnerability and potential solutions to emerging risks, and to assess the suitability through life cycle cost and carbon footprint. This initiative is relatively new to the industry. The new insight into life cycle assessment or LCA (especially carbon footprint over the life cycle) integrated with digital twin applications will enable sustainable development that will enhance resilience of metro railway systems globally. © 2020 by the authors."

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is one of the most important efforts to manage information collaboratively within the AEC industry. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) can be used as a data format to achieve data exchange between diverse software applications in a BIM process. The advantage of using Semantic Web Technologies to overcome these challenges has been recognised by the AEC community and the ifcOWL ontology, which transforms the IFC schema to a Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation, is now a de facto standard. Even though the ifcOWL ontology is very extensive, there is a lack of detailed knowledge representation in terms of process and sub-processes explaining Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) for offsite construction, and also a lack of knowledge on how product and productivity measurement such as production costs and durations are incurred, which is essential for evaluation of alternative DfMA design options. In this article we present a new ontology named ifcOWL-DfMA as a new domain specific module for ifcOWL with the aim of representing offsite construction domain terminology and relationships in a machine-interpretable format. This ontology will play the role of a core vocabulary for the DfMA design management and can be used in many scenarios such as life cycle cost estimation. To demonstrate the usage of ifcOWL-DfMA ontology a production line of wall panels is presented. We evaluate our approach by querying the wall panel production model about information such as activity sequence, cost estimation per activity and also the direct material cost. This ultimately enable users to evaluate the overall product from the system. Copyright © LDAC2020 for this paper by its authors."

The guidelines for the construction products' determining prices disclosing methods have been developed. However, in practice, the investor estimates, which is an important condition, but not sufficient are used as basic. The need for an accurate calculation of the investment construction project cost for both the investor and the contractor dictates the new requirements for finding approaches to the materials' systematization, as well as streamlining the procedure for calculating the construction products' price. At the pre-investment stage of design, cost optimization should be carried out by calculating the capital investments using the aggregated indicators. In this situation, priority attention should be directed to rationing and labor costs. The calculation of probable labor costs for a certain period will make it possible to increase the validity of the decisions taken at the initial stage of the investment construction project's development.

These characteristics expose hydropower projects to various uncertainties and risks such as economic, environmental, social, geological, regulatory, political, technological, financial, climate, natural, and safety. These risk factors, if not managed in time, lead to schedule and cost overruns which ultimately cause delays in the availability of power that too at a higher cost and in extreme cases lead to project failures. Sustainability has also become a critical and unavoidable issue in hydropower development due to associated environmental and social impacts. Sustainable development is related to techno-economic development along with preserving the environment. Hence, to assure this equity and manage the critical risks more efficiently, there arises a strong need for comprehensive risk management in hydropower projects. This paper presents a systematic review of risk management in hydropower projects with a specific focus on sustainable development. The paper discusses various risk assessment techniques and recommends sensitivity analysis as a primary method to evaluate the significant risk factors. The construction phase of hydropower projects is identified as the most critical phase associated with uncertainties and involves considerable cost. Thus, the review highlights the need for incorporation of risk analysis in the cost estimation process and the provision for finance with sufficient margin on the ex-ante base cost to account for uncertainties, especially for developing countries. For future research, the use of fuzzy hybridized with artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is suggested for risk assessment of hydropower projects. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

Constantly growing commercial market, especially the one of public utility constructions, makes the contractor, at the stage of development the design concept, initially estimate the cost of the facade, e.g. office buildings, commercial buildings, etc., which are most often implemented in the form of aluminum-glass facades or ventilated elevations. The valuation of facade systems is of an individual calculation nature, which makes the process complicated, time-consuming, and requiring a high cost estimation work. The authors suggest using a model for estimating the cost of facade systems with the use of statistical methods based on multiple and stepwise regression. The data base used to form statistical models is the result of quantitative-qualitative research of the design and cost documentation of completed public facilities.

Construction joint ventures (CJVs) present an opportunity for merging competences of collaborating firms, in addition to sharing costs, resources, and reducing investment risks. One of the major challenges to CJVs formation is reaching a consensus on revenue-sharing strategies within the limited duration for project bidding process. This paper proposes a model for sharing revenue in a CJV based on cooperative game theory solution concepts. In contrast to traditional investment-based revenue sharing approaches, the proposed model defines the fair share for each of the participating parties based on their marginal contribution to the coalition. The authors developed a parametric model based on well-recognized cooperative game theory solutions that can guide decision-makers in the formation phase of a CJV. A case study is applied to test the model and compare the results against traditional revenue sharing concepts. The proposed model enables firms to establish a fair CJV agreement, which satisfies the rationality constraint for each party.

A specific guideline to predict the construction of DWs in underground station is still not available. In order to overcome these challenges, the criteria affecting PR for the construction of DWs should be hence defined and the factors that impact the construction productivity of DWs should be well understood. Briefly and given the limitations of previous research work, we gathered and compiled a comprehensive key list of all criteria based on previous reports. This comprehensive key list was later reviewed by underground construction and specialized experts to define, identify and distinguish the most important criterion affecting the construction productivity of DWs in Egypt. We developed two questionnaire surveys to conduct these interviews with the experts. This obtained criterion was ranked and weighted using Simos’ procedure based on prioritizing the influencing criteria. Our findings concluded that the ground condition type/and characteristics, soil–machine interaction, machine type and model characteristics (grab/or cutter), breakdowns and de-sender efficiency are significantly influencing the excavation rate. Additionally, factors such as cage type (fiber/or steel), connection type (welding/or mechanical) and volume of steel fixing crew are crucial to identify the rate of installation cages. On the other side, the arrival time of concrete car mixer and panel volume were determined to significantly impact the concrete casting rate. In summary, this study presented a distinctive weighting and ranking methodology of the influencing criteria for the PR of DWs.

The typical processes involved in achieving cost estimates are: (1) classification and matching of model elements to their various categories; (2) taking off quantities from design documents or building information models; (3) retrieving unit cost from a cost database; and (4) applying the unit costs and quantities in computing the cost estimate. Although, the level of automation in quantity takeoff has been relatively high, most commercial software programs still require manual inputs from estimators to: (1) match materials of building elements to work items; and/or (2) fulfill essential information requirements that may be missing from design models for accurate cost estimate computations. These missing information are usually obtained from the construction specifications in supplement to the design models. Automating the process of design information extraction from construction specifications can help reduce: (1) the time and cost of the estimation, (2) the manual inputs required in cost estimation computations, and (3) human errors in cost estimates. This paper explores the use of natural language processing techniques to help process construction specifications and the authors propose a new algorithmic method for extracting the needed design information from construction specifications to support wood construction cost estimation. A case study was conducted on a wood construction project to evaluate the authors' proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method successfully searched for and found design details from construction specifications to fulfil essential information requirements for detailed wood construction cost estimation, with a 94.9% precision and a 97.4% recall. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Industry foundation classes- (IFC-) based BIM allows building information to be interoperable among different BIM applications. Different stakeholders take different responsibilities in a project and therefore keep different types of information to meet project requirements. In this paper, the authors proposed and adopted a six-step methodology to support BIM interoperability between architectural design and structural analysis at both AEC project level and information level, in which (1) the intrinsic and extrinsic information transferred between architectural models and structural models was analyzed and demonstrated by a business process model and notation (BPMN) model that the authors developed; (2) the proposed technical routes with different combinations and their applications to different project delivery methods provided new instruments to stakeholders in industry for efficient and accurate decision making; (3) a new material-centered invariant signature with portability can improve information exchange between different data formats and models to support interoperable BIM applications; and (4) a newly developed formal material information representation and checking method was tested on a case study where its efficiency was demonstrated to outperform (i) proprietary representations and information checking method based on a manual operation, and (ii) the model view definition (MVD)-based information checking method. The proposed invariant signature-based material information representation and checking method brings a better efficiency for information transfer between architectural design and structural analysis, which can have significant positive effects on a project delivery due to the frequent and iterative update of a project design. This improves the information transfer and coordination between architects and structural engineers and therefore the efficiency of the whole project. The proposed method can be extended and applied to other application phases and functions such as cost estimation, scheduling, and energy analysis.  © 2021 Ran Ren and Jiansong Zhang."

BIM is important for various stakeholders including contractors to adopt in order to boost project performance. However, the previous report showed that the adoption of BIM among contractors is still low compared to other stakeholders. This is because the contractors have no profound understanding of BIM and its requirements. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to determine the uses of BIM from the contractors' perspective by adopting BIM from the planning phase to the construction phase as well as to determine the reliability and validity of the research instrument. A component questionnaire on Building Information Modelling (BIM) had been developed to determine the uses of BIM among contractors in Malaysia. This study was conducted in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, which involved 100 respondents, in order to affirm the development of valid and reliable instrument. The reliability test and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) were used to measure the instrument to produce an empirical verification of the validity and reliability of the questionnaires. Literature search and a pilot study on contractors involved in BIM-based projects were carried out from which the appropriate items were extracted. From these, twenty (20) items remained and were to be completed in the study: fourteen (14) items were BIM uses from the planning to the designing phase and six (6) items were BIM uses in the construction phase. The fourteen (14) items used to measure from the planning to the design phase comprised existing condition, cost estimation, phase planning, programming, site analysis, design review, design authoring, structural analysis, lighting analysis, energy analysis, mechanical analysis, other engineering analysis, sustainability evaluation (LEED), and code validation. Meanwhile, six (6) BIM uses for the construction phase consisted of 3D coordination, site utilizing planning, construction system design, digital fabrication, 3D control and planning, and record model. All twenty (20) items had high reliability index value, which was between 0.7 and 0.8. Accordingly, the factor analysis outcome resulted in two (2) components, obtained with 40.938% of cumulative variance, while the factor loading for each component ranged from 0.5 to 0.7, reflecting the dimension of the two (2) components. Hence, the result obtained proved that the instrument of this study had high reliability and validity. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research."

The model uses raster-based GIS data and considers multiple design factors influencing the optimal landing location. Terrain conditions, the volume of stock distribution, downhill and uphill skidding directions, and distance to the existing road were the influencing design factors in the model. Three approaches were adopted for finding a landing location within three harvest units. In the first approach, a preliminary process evaluated all cells of a 20 m × 20 m network within the harvest units and determined the candidate landing cells with the largest gentle slope (<10%) area. In the second and third approaches, the points on a 50 m × 50 m mesh grid and the harvest units' centroids were assumed as candidate landings, respectively. The sum of skidding, road construction, and hauling costs was as total harvesting costs. Results indicated that the distance to the existing roads and the access direction from the existing road to the candidate landings could effectively limit the choice options for landing location. Results of feeding a penalized cost estimation model as an objective function to the modified Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm led to planning the road alignments with the least expected excavation and soil disturbance. Results also showed that the optimal landings could ensure the least total harvesting cost within the harvest unit. © 2021 I. Ghajar"

This would enable validation of methods themselves by comparing and evaluating the obtained relevant parameters. Comparison would be performed on two levels, based on its general characteristics, as well as on the results of their application on the basis of 24 building reconstructions and new buildings by comparing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the determination coefficient (R2) using Predictive Modelling Software DTREG (pronounced D-T-Reg).

That relationship would enable more realistic budget planning of similar future projects.

This was basically due to the absence of estimating models that yield running costs at the early design stage. Often, when the design of a building, which is responsible for 10–15% of its total cost, is completed, 80% of the total cost is committed. This study aims to develop a building characteristic-based model, which is an early-stage determinant of running costs of buildings, to predict the running costs of commercial buildings. Design/methodology/approach: A desk study was carried out to collect running costs data and building characteristics of 35 commercial buildings in Sri Lanka. A Pareto analysis, bivariate correlation analysis and hedonic regression modelling were performed on collected data. Findings: According to Pareto analysis, utilities, services, admin work and cleaning are four main cost constituents, responsible for 80% of running costs, which can be represented by highly correlated building characteristics of building height, number of floors and size. Approximately 94% of the variance in annual running costs/sq. m is expressed by variables of number of floors, net floor area and working hours/day together with a mean prediction accuracy of 2.89%. Research limitations/implications: The study has utilised a sample of 35 commercial buildings due to non-availability and difficulty in accessing running cost data. Originality/value: Early-stage supportive running costs estimation model proposed by the study would enable construction professionals to benchmark the running costs and thereby optimise the building design. The developed hedonic model illustrated the variance of running costs concerning the changes in characteristics of a building. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this study based on the convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm the prediction of the expressway construction cost was analyzed with respect to the conceptual design stage. By summarizing the existing research results 10 new factors related to the bridge and tunnel are creatively introduced into the cost-prediction index of the expressway conceptual design stage. In addition the data structure of the expressway project cost prediction is defined and a CNN model is established. Finally the project information of 415 expressways in China collected in this study is used to verify the research results. The results of the case analysis show that the 10 new indexes related to the bridge and tunnel can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. In addition the CNN model is more suitable for solving the high-dimensional nonlinear problem of expressway cost prediction than the conventional artificial-neural-network and regression-analysis models and it can improve the prediction accuracy. The findings of this study can be used to devise financial plans in the early stage of expressway construction and facilitate cost management at the conceptual design stage to help investors acquire project funds in advance.  © 2013 IEEE.

The system has been applied to approximately three thousand real steel structure constructions in Japan. The sprayed zinc-aluminum pseudo alloy in the system has superior corrosion prevention effect for a long-term based on sacrificial anodic protection and atmospheric isolation. The outline, characteristics, steel corrosion prevention mechanism of the spraying system and the actual condition survey results of structures applied the system more than 10 years ago had been introduced in past IABMAS 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 proceedings. Furthermore, in 2012 proceedings a life cycle cost estimation of the spraying system had been discussed based on only limited data from three actual steel bridges applied the system. In this paper, the actual condition survey results for 39 steel bridges applied the metal spraying system about 5 to 20 years ago in Japan (from Hokkaido to Okinawa) have been reported to discuss in more detail durability of the sprayed zinc-aluminum pseudo alloy onto steel bridges. The surveyed bridges are in coastal zone, urban district and rural area. Classification estimation standard for degradation of the sprayed metal and coating on them has been established and deterioration degree has been quantitatively calculated. Deterioration phenomena for the evaluation includes the coating blistering, cracking, peeling and substratum steel rust. After that, on-site visual observation of the bridge appearance has been carried out. As a result, main degradation factors of the metal spraying system in the long-term can be pointed out environment of the construction location and elements of the structure. These factors more seriously influence the deterioration of steel bridges than mere time elapsed from the metal spraying construction. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, London"

In addition, the introduction of Life Cycle Costing (LCC) leads in providing a better and comprehensive cost estimation; as well as provides a significant advantage in the preparation of cost estimates, hence it provides a better baseline for decision making. The lacking application of LCC in IBS is still in trivial impact, where Malaysia experiences a slower progress of IBS construction, even though robust steps has been taken by the Government to influence construction players to accommodate LCC in projecting a comprehensive cost estimates, especially for IBS projects. This paper highlights an outcome of study that simulate the causal effect relationship between IBS Cost Factors and LCC Cost Distribution. A questionnaire survey was used to associate the IBS cost factors and LCC cost distribution and followed by Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis which validate the relationships between the factors. The result of analysis was developed based on findings from 102 responded questionnaires which were distributed to Quantity Surveyors from various agencies. There were 5 LCC cost distribution factors used in this research and 43 IBS Cost Factors to get associated with. SEM-PLS was used to eliminate the cost association by eliminating factors recorded a loading value less than 0.70. From 43 IBS Cost Factors used earlier, only 15 cost factors were retain for further analysis and the development of a cost estimates using LCC approach. The outcome of this analysis is expected to guide the construction players to achieve more practical cost estimates and feasible alternatives for decision making in IBS construction, by focusing on the critical cost contributed to the overall cost of IBS project in Malaysia. © 2021, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

As CBR relies on historical data, it is important to perform data preprocessing to obtain high-quality of base cases. Normalization preprocessing gives all attributes standard scores so that they can be compared. This research examines the effects of normalization methods through performance evaluations of normalization-based CBR models to improve construction cost estimation in the early design stages. Multi-family housing complexes were used as case studies, and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used for model validation. The performance of the CBR models was evaluated using the mean absolute error rate (MAER), mean squared deviation (MSD), mean absolute deviation (MAD), and standard deviation (SD) for accuracy and stability. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method was used to examine the appropriateness of the normalization methods. The results are expected to contribute to the enhancement of accuracy and stability of CBR-based cost estimation and to support decision-making. The suggested method could also be applied to other CBR areas such as energy prediction, noise management, bid decision-making, and scheduling, as well as other data-oriented methods, such as regression analysis and artificial neural networks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Some characteristics of nuclear power plant projects (e.g., variability of projects portfolio, type of nuclear projects, security, and safety requirements) may bring along schedule delay and cost overrun, and that can be resulted in termination of nuclear power plant's operating license. To overcome these challenges, this study develops a model that is capable of improving the accuracy of cost and schedule estimation for nuclear power plant projects. The forecasting model is designed in three steps: (i) identifying the causal factors of delay for nuclear power plant projects; (2) developing a schedule and cost performance model; and (3) implementing the model to evaluate and refine its performance on real-case nuclear power plant projects. This study mainly focuses on construction projects to maintain and upgrade existing nuclear power plants. The model is also validated by project management portfolio of a nuclear power plant in Michigan, USA.

It should not be forgotten that ship design and construction is also a business venture and must succeed financially, as well. In the quality, cost and schedule triangle, quality seems to be the only constant because the demand on shipyards is to fabricate faster, more cost efficiently and without sacrificing quality. That leaves the cost and schedule as variables. Labor cost and workstation productivity are the two major areas where a shipyard can gain considerable savings by examining the estimated labor time against the actual fabrication time at each workstation with the purpose of improving productivity. This estimating approach aims to provide a computer-based cost estimating method to improve the current manual methods by connecting to a 3-D model and the “behind the scenes” properties of already-modeled parts in time and cost estimation after the build strategy and basic assembly drawings are developed. It treats the shipbuilding as a fabrication process that takes place in many workstations. The time it takes to perform each task at each workstation becomes an important input value for the approach. The estimating approach presented in this paper will be helpful for cutting down the estimating time and obtaining production related, insightful, information. It may be another valuable tool for increasing profits. Copyright © 2020 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)."

The current state of research for automated cycle time prediction for construction operations is based on processing kinematic data (e.g., acceleration) or implementing computer vision algorithms. Both methods have certain limitations (e.g., it is necessary to directly attach kinematic sensors to machines, and computer vision algorithms are very sensitive to lighting conditions and occlusions). In addition, current methods predict cycle time values once (usually at the beginning of projects) and do not include an ""auto-update"" component capable of adjusting results over time and due to variations, such as changes in jobsite conditions or impacts of learning curve, for example. To address these two important issues, the authors propose an audio-based Bayesian system for estimating cycle times of cyclic construction activities. The sounds generated during routine operations of construction equipment and machines are treated as the main source of data for this project, and efficient signal processing and machine learning algorithms are implemented to process recorded audio files at construction jobsites and extract useful information. A robust denoising algorithm was developed to improve the quality of audio files, and Bayesian statistical models are utilized to include historical data for cycle time estimation enhancement. Case studies illustrate that implementing robust audio signal processing techniques, along with a Markov chain-based filter, enable the system to accurately forecast cycle times of construction activities for multiple days of operation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."

However, this success is contingent on effective cost management practices that share cost data with all project stakeholders in an accurate, timely and transparent manner. Despite an extensive literature on aspects of cost management, none identifies the essential ingredients required of an effective cost management system, sufficiently robust to support successful IPD projects. Candidate cost management augmenting practices are drawn from the literature, and presented for scrutiny in questionnaire form, to fifty IPD experienced experts, based in the USA, UK and Australia. Findings reveal activity-based costing (ABC) to be effective at identifying overhead costs and creating accounting transparency. Similarly, earned value management (EVM), in combination with ABC, is effective at developing mathematical models for equitable risk-reward distribution. Moreover, web-based management systems, as supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM), are effective at generating trust and collaboration on which IPD success depends. A questionnaire survey using purposive sampling was conducted to assess the factors driving success of implementing IPD regarding cost management process. The contribution to knowledge made by this paper is in identifying requisite support mechanisms essential to elevate traditional cost management practices to the higher standard needed to ensure IPD delivery success. © 2020 by the authors.

However, previous probabilistic cost estimation models are mostly devoid of loss-sharing considerations. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic cost estimation model integrating risk allocation and claim. The bargaining game between the owner and the contractor is first used to determine the proportion of risk allocation in the price fluctuation and the claim amount in the engineering quantity variation. Then, these two key parameters are incorporated into a Monte Carlo-based probabilistic cost risk simulation. The proposed model is applied to an actual hydropower project, and the results show that the risk reserve fund of the proposed model only accounts for 2.66% of the budget under 80% completion probability, and the average cost risk sensitive coefficient of the proposed model has more than tripled. From the results, the cost estimation value calculated by the novel model is more competitive and accurate in bidding; in addition, to reduce additional cost expenditures, the contractor should maintain a high level of patience during negotiations. This research contributes to improving the probability of winning a contract without sacrificing the contractor's profit and to extending the current theory of probabilistic cost estimation.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

This aspect is particularly relevant for strategic structures and infrastructures, whose functionalities are crucial in case of seismic events. Objective: The main aim of the present paper is to share the key findings related to the seismic vulnerability assessment of the National Institute for the Study and Treatment of Cancer (IRCCS) “Giovanni Pascale Foundation” in Naples. In particular, the main evidences could be easily extended to existing hospitals realized in the last century, with the main reference to: construction techniques, quality of constructional material, overt and convert seismic vulnerabilities and possible intervention strategies for risk mitigation. Methods: In the present paper, the assessment methodologies adopted for such a strategic hospital complex are provided, focusing in particular on: i. preliminary research of original design documents and on-site investigation for determining constructional details; ii. material tests on structural elements; iii. vulnerability seismic assessment by means of non-linear FE analyses (push-over and capacity spectrum method); iv. recommendations on retrofitting measures and cost estimations. Results: The conducted study puts into clear evidence the inadequacy of the investigated buildings to face the design seismic actions provided by the current Italian code and thus showed the significant seismic vulnerabilities affecting the Institute “G. Pascale Foundation” of Naples. Among these, particular attention has also been focused on the so-called intrinsic vulnerabilities, namely the ones not measurable explicitly and interesting non-structural elements (e.g., connection of shelves, stained glass windows, facilities, etc.). Conclusion: The presented case study highlights the strong seismic vulnerability affecting structures realized in the past century, despite their strategic functions. On the whole, the examined structures can be considered as representative of this building typology, and the adopted calculation criteria, as well as the assumptions of the assessment process, could be easily extended to similar case studies. © 2021 Zizi et al."

A combination of these fibers also demonstrated an improvement in strength as well as ductility characteristics, especially with regard to tension and flexure.

In the modern highly competitive economic environment, contraction of product prime cost is a critical factor in the development of any manufacturing company. In this regard, a tremendous role is attached to the method of the prime cost calculation, as well as the selection of a cost accounting method aimed at enhancement of the efficiency, completeness of accounting and monitoring of costs. One of the methods of cost estimation is cost accounting. Its main objective is to identify the cost-determining factors of overhead costs. In cost accounting, a cost sheet is compiled, where the costs for a unit of output can be estimated by accounting items. After studying the existing approaches to costing, the article solves the main problems associated with the application of the standard cost-based accounting on the example of the construction industry.

The Inflation rate is considered as a primary factor which causes cost overrun. To examine this scenario in the construction industry of Pakistan, this study has been performed. The materials prices were examined statistically with the inflation rate to evaluate their correlation. First, the percentage deviation was calculated to examine the variations in the prices. Afterwards, the Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to investigate their interrelation. Based on the results it was revealed that inflation rate is the foremost factor in diverging the prices, as it was found to be strongly correlated. The strong relationship indicates that the shift in the inflation rate raises the prices of the materials, resulting in project cost overrun. Here, in this case, the relationship appeared to be inversely proportional. Therefore, the construction industry's decision-makers need to come up with a solution to incorporate the inflation rate in cost estimation at the bidding stage. © 2020 IEEE."

Among various AEC tools, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has gained popularity due to its collaboration platform enabling cross-disciplinary teamwork during whole life cycle of buildings. BIM has further transformed culture and processes associated with design, construction and operation of buildings, hence triggering new building regulations in developed countries. However, in developing countries, BIM implementation is facing several barriers, such as lack of investment in technology and training, hesitation in quitting traditional tools and practices, etc. The purpose of this paper is to highlight potentials of BIM for developing countries, which are in need of more sustainable policies for enhancing their economic and environmental performances. Design/methodology/approach: Throughout the text, a literature review on BIM including its dimensions and benefits, impacts on architectural design and adoption in global and local contexts is provided. In case study, surveys and structured interviews are conducted with BIM user and non-BIM user architects throughout Pakistan. Beyond 2D/3D modeling, the use of BIM applications for sustainable design process such as scheduling (4D), cost estimation (5D), performance analysis and facilities management (6D) is investigated. Findings: Using analytical tools of an online surveying tool and SPSS statistical software, barriers and motivations for BIM implementation in Pakistan are determined. Strategies for further BIM adoption and implementation via “education and training institutions” and “supporting organizations and institutions” are defined. Originality/value: As a developing country, Pakistan shall be moving the barriers for the spread of BIM technology. Recent research covered the entire AEC sector (Masood et al., 2014; Sohu et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2018), yet this paper focuses specifically on architectural design and practice field. In order to find out experiences and expectations about BIM technology in the architecture sector, professionals are surveyed and four chief architects are interviewed. How far have Pakistani architects adopted BIM? For which project types and scales is BIM more serviceable for them? Which BIM applications are they implementing to overcome the limitations in their professional practice? In Pakistan, where sustainability, in terms of scheduling, cost estimation, performance analysis and facilities management, is an indispensible measure for local practices, has implementation of BIM technology achieved sustainability in architectural design process?

Learning curve theory is actively implemented for both the scheduling and cost estimation of complex construction projects. The purpose of the research is to assess the suitability of published learning curve models in effectively analyzing the learning phenomenon for substantially complex construction operations. The research investigates five (5) learning curve models, namely the (a) Straight-line or Wright, (b) Stanford “B”, (c) Cubic, (d) Piecewise or Stepwise and (e) Exponential models. The methodology includes the comparative implementation of each one of the aforementioned models for the analysis of a large infrastructure project with the use of unit and cumulative productivity data. A two-stage investigative process for the five models was applied in order to define (a) the best-fit model for historical productivity data of completed construction activities and (b) the best predictor model of future performance. The assessment criterion for the suitability is the deviation of the real construction data from the predictions generated by each model. The research results indicate that the Cubic model dominates in terms of its predictive capability on historical data, while the Stanford “B” model is a better future performance predictor. Future research directions include the extension of the research scope with the inclusion of more learning curve models in conjunction with a populated database of historical field data. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Accordingly, the cost associated with transportation operations is considerable compared to a traditional stick build. Nevertheless, transportation cost estimation has often relied on a fixed-cost approach, regarding the cost as part of the overhead cost, rather than conducting detailed estimation of actual transportation operations. This is because operation-level data might be challenging to collect and analyze in practice. In this regard, the prevalent use of GPS devices for construction equipment may provide an automated means of monitoring the operations of transportation equipment, and large and detailed spatial and temporal data can be generated from multiple pieces of equipment in multiple construction projects on a daily basis or even in real time. This study thus proposes a spatial and temporal data filtering and abstracting approach to transportation cost estimation using fleet GPS data which extracts equipment activities from the GPS data and accordingly predicts the transportation demands required for an individual project. From large-scale GPS data, key operation information, such as the number of trailers and durations required (i.e., transportation demands), is extracted using a geo-fence and a rule-based equipment operation analysis algorithm. Then, the extracted transportation demand information, along with related project specifications, is used to train support vector regression (SVR) models for the purpose of predicting the transportation demand in new projects, which is in turn utilized to estimate the transportation cost using the relevant transportation unit cost of the equipment. To evaluate the performance, GPS datasets collected from 221 panelized residential projects over a period of 8 months are used to train the prediction model and are compared with actual transportation costs estimated in practice. The results show that the SVR model has an accuracy of 86% and 88% in predicting the number of trailers and the duration, respectively. For the cost estimation performance, the results reveal that the average cost difference of 57% between the fixed cost and the actual transportation cost was reduced to 14% by implementing the GPS-data-based method in various project locations and for projects of various sizes. The GPS-data-based estimation approach thus is found to provide a more accurate transportation cost estimation result for various panelized construction projects, and the method improves the understanding of large-scale spatial and temporal equipment data while increasing the utilization of the GPS data already available. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Real data were collected from 174 real residential projects in Egypt. The Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the key factors affecting early stage cost estimation. Artificial neural network models were developed with various numbers of hidden layers and types of activation functions. The sensitivity analysis showed that the most effective factors in the cost estimate at the early stage are the number of floors and the area of the floors. The multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, gamma regression, and Poisson regression were used. The proposed hybrid model was extracted from the ANN model and the regression models using multiple linear regression. The mean absolute percentage error of the hybrid model was 10.64% which is less than the absolute percentage error of the ANN model and the regression models.

Digitalization can help to make use of this potential and improve sustainability throughout the entire building's life cycle. One way to address this potential is through the integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into the building process by employing Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM can reduce the effort needed to carry out an LCA, and therefore, facilitate the integration into the building process. Areview of current industry practice and scientific literature shows that companies are lacking the incentive to apply LCA. If applied, there are two main approaches. Either the LCA is performed in a simplified way at the beginning of the building process using imprecise techniques, or it is done at the very end when all the needed information is available, but it is too late for decision-making. One reason for this is the lack of methods, workflows and tools to implement BIM-LCA integration over the whole building development. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop an integrated BIM-LCA method for the entire building process by relating it to an established workflow. To avoid an additional effort for practitioners, an existing structure for cost estimation in the Swiss context is used. The established method is implemented in a tool and used in a case study in Switzerland to test the approach. The results of this study show that LCA can be performed continuously in each building phase over the entire building process using existing Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques for cost estimation. The main benefit of this approach is that it simplifies the application of LCA in the building process and therefore gives incentives for companies to apply it. Moreover, the re-work caused by the need for re-entering data and the usage of many different software tools that characterize most of the current LCA practices is minimized. Furthermore, decision-making, both at the element and building levels, is supported. © 2020 by the authors."

Model View Definitions (MVD) enable to specify a subset of the IFC schema to assess the content of a model for specific use cases and information exchanges. However, IFC and MVD paradoxically complexify the workflow since it requires a deep understanding of the schema combined with construction knowledge to carry out simple use cases such as quantity checking or data export. This gap between domain specific queries and their expression in a computer-readable language weakens the opportunities provided to the building industry by Building Information Modeling. Our research consists in the implementation of MVDs in a high-level programming language to extract data from building models, an assessment of the extraction results and geometrical processing algorithms to correct the explicit quantities and properties that are supplied as metadata alongside the elements in IFC building models. Geometrical processing can be used to reduce and eventually correct errors on property values. We use a generic geometrical representation of IFC entity instances and apply geometrical transformations on those to obtain geometrical shapes. Boolean operations are used to identify relationships between elements. Eventually, incorrect data values are corrected directly in the IFC models accordingly to the IFC schema. For instance, we authored an MVD to extract data pertaining to external walls from different IFC models and corrected the value of the IsExternal property of the models’ IfcWall entities. This use case is of great importance for the cost estimation of a thermal renovation on a building as it gives a good estimate of the outer surface area of the building envelope. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

For this purpose, approaches for cost estimation have been explored thoroughly, however they are not employed extensively in practice. The main goal of this paper is to comparing the performance of various models in predicting the cost of construction projects at early conceptual phase in the project development. In this study, on the basis of the actual project data, three modeling algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural networks are used to forecast the construction cost of Ethiopian highway projects. The three models were then compared based on the outcomes of prediction and root mean square error. The findings revealed that random forest outperforms neural network and support vector machine in realizing better prediction accuracy. Based on root mean square error, the random forest cost model provides 18.8% and 23.4% more accurate result than neural network and support vector machine models respectively. It is anticipated that a more reliable cost estimation model could be designed in the early project phases by using a random forest regression technique in the development of a highway construction cost estimation model.

Ongoing bridge failures, often during the construction of innovative designs, underscore the need to re-emphasise safety and design fundamentals when pursuing aesthetic designs. The inability to provide timely reasonable cost estimates likewise leads to later embarrassing surprises. Public confidence in the bridge engineering profession suffers. This paper is not about the numerous aids to facilitate aesthetic concept development. It attempts to promote bridge conceptual design that is amenable to control. Well-reported historic failures, focusing on pioneering bridges and novel and elegant designs, are reviewed for retrospective insight and current relevance. The repeated findings of loss of control in the design and/or construction process suggest the benefit of forward risk assessment, value engineering and constructability analysis, at concept, for both structure soundness and cost estimation, especially for major signature structures.

Measuring the similarity of construction projects improves the efficiency of the existing information systems in retrieval of relevant cases. It was hypothesized that the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) of projects contains the necessary information to measure the semantic similarity of construction projects; therefore, WBS can be used as a potential representative of the projects. In this research project, a novel method is proposed to assess the semantic similarity of projects by application of natural language processing techniques. In this method, a new project is compared with the documented as-built projects based on their WBS similarity. This method is implemented using two metrics: (1) node similarity that compares the semantics of all nodes in two WBSs; (2) structural similarity which compares the topology of the work breakdown structures. The proposed system calculates a similarity score between 0 and 1 for each metric and the combination of these two scores provides the final similarity score between a pair of WBSs, thus it could rank the similarity of the documented cases to the new project based on their final scores. Experimental results indicated that the structural similarity produced about 15 percent higher degree of retrieval precision than the node similarity. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

Cost estimators are still experiencing the difficulty of obtaining supportive information because most of the raw data is stored separately and cannot be easily traced. Previously proposed building information modeling (BIM)-based database did not produce cross-project historical data and also required extra effort in the design phase. To address the limitations, this paper considers building an independent relational database (RDB) as a data tracking tool. A preliminary RDB schema for conceptual estimating was developed in this paper. This RDB extracted and fused data from BIM models, bill of quantities (BoQs), and payment records using open tool MySQL. Simulated cost data of VDC Research Center was used as a case study. Three queries were coded and tested as validation. It can be concluded that BIM and cross-project RDB integrated data tracking method is helpful in conceptual cost estimating.

In addition, the estimated quantity may result in inaccurate cost owing to drawing errors or quantity surveyors’ mistake, and it is not the exact quantity to be put into actual construction, which can cause numerous problems in the construction phase. If the information can be automatically received for estimation, the exact quantity for construction can be estimated without omission or errors.

This case study investigated the process of integrating different dimensions of information such as time scheduling (4D) and cost estimation (5D) with a 3D model to simulate a 5D Building Information Modelling (BIM) process. The study explored the application of VDC with 5D BIM for a commercial building, namely Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) Sungai Long City Campus. Through this case study, it enables comparisons of a virtual model and an actual construction in order to evaluate the advantages, practicality, and limitations of the VDC applications. The 5D model provided comprehensive information to manage the complex design-construction process by considering its timeline and cost. Six modelling stages were undertaken, namely inputting and modelling, clash detection test, time scheduling, quantification and cost estimation, virtualization, and walkthrough of the model. The results revealed that the practicability of the 5D BIM was influenced by the modelling effort, inter-operability, information output and limitations. The study also showed that VDC with 5D BIM significantly reduced the technical barrier for clients to participate in construction project, thus increasing the clients' satisfaction of the works by bridging the gap of perception and actual outcomes from the construction. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

This is about 1.2 million buildings. If we translate these figures into carbon footprint (CF) generated during the construction, it will be approximately 3.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide. The contractors all over the world - also in Poland - decide to calculate the carbon footprint for various reasons, but mostly they are compelled to do so by the market. The analysis of costs and emissions of greenhouse gases for individual phases of the construction system allows implementing solutions and preventing a negative impact on the environment without increasing the construction costs. The share of each phase in the amount of produced carbon for construction and use of the building depends mainly on the used materials and applied design solutions. Hence, the materials and solutions with lesser carbon footprint should be used. It can be achieved by using natural materials or materials which do not need much energy to be produced.

Many uncertainties disturb the planners' initial estimations and lead to cost overruns. Although many researchers highlighted the correlation between economic conditions and construction costs, accurate quantification of the impact of this correlation has not yet been reached. This paper proposes three models that utilize artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the future prices of major construction materials, namely steel reinforcement bars and portland cement, in the context of the Egyptian construction industry 6 months ahead. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that also utilizes genetic algorithm (GA), NeuralTools software, and Python programing language in Spyder software was used to develop the three models. Historical data of steel and cement prices as well as macroeconomic indicators in Egypt from May 2008 to June 2018 were used for training, testing, and validation of the proposed models. The inputs to the proposed ANN models are the identified leading economic indicators such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, and Consumer Price Index (CPI). The developed ANN models show promising results in prediction of month-to-month variations in material prices while having mean-absolute-percentage error that ranges from 4.0% to 11% for the different models. The proposed models can potentially be useful tools for construction contractors as well as owners for predicting and quantifying the fluctuations of major construction materials prices to prepare mitigation measures that will reduce the extra costs incurred. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and process the integration of information in a shared environment. This paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance. This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors."

Sufficiently precise cost estimation is essential for investors in the pre-investment stage where they decide on whether to pursue an investment and choose a suitable technical solution for the development of the project. Through a detailed analysis of the technical and economic documentation pertaining to seven sport facilities projects assembled using concrete prefabricated beam parts, as well as evaluation of the data thus obtained, three types of technical-economic indicators were set in relation to the enclosed building area, the number of spectator seats and the sports playing area. The results achieved indicate that evaluation of relations between these three indicators could contribute to a more effective use of investment funding on the part of the investor. Other conclusions include the finding that available indicators published by private companies active in the area of construction budgeting are not sufficiently accurate for the purposes of investment decision-making; specifically, these indicators greatly overestimate the costs of sport facilities, which can potentially lead to these projects being rejected.

Building refurbishment is considered a practical pathway towards energy efficiency as the replacement of older buildings is at a slow pace. There are various ways of incorporating energy conservation measures in buildings through refurbishment projects. As such, we have to choose among various passive or active measures. In this study, we develop an integrated assessment model to direct energy management decisions in retrofit projects. Our focus will be on alternative passive measures that can be included in refurbishment projects to reduce overall energy consumption in buildings. We identify the relative priority of these alternatives with respect to their non-monetary (qualitative) benefits and issues using an analytic network process. Then, the above priorities will form a utility function that will be optimized along with the energy demand and retrofit costs using a multi-objective optimization model. We also explore various approaches to formulate the uncertainties that may arise in cost estimations and incorporate them into the optimization model. The applicability and authenticity of the proposed model is demonstrated through an illustrative case study application. The results reveal that the choice of the optimization approach for a retrofit project shall be done with respect to the extent of variations (uncertainties) in expected utilities (benefits) and costs for the alternative passive technologies. © 2019 Southwest Jiaotong University"

This is because the nature of the construction industry is shaped by changes in domestic and foreign economic factors, socio-financial issues, and is under the influence of various micro and macro factors. This paper presents a fuzzy decision-making approach for calculating critical factors that affect the construction price index. A qualitative approach was implemented based on in-depth interviews of experts in the construction industry in Vietnam. A synthetic comparison matrix was calculated using Buckley approach. The CoA approach was applied to defuzzified the fuzzy weights of factors that affect the construction price index. The research results show that the top five critical factors affecting the construction price index in Vietnam are (1) consumer price index, (2) gross domestic product, (3) basic interest rate, (4) foreign exchange rate, and (5) total export and import. © The Author(s)."

Previous research and efforts have predominantly focussed on the use of technologies for cost estimation and quantity takeoff within a more traditional-led procurement, with a paucity of research focussing on how 5D BIM could facilitate costing within contractor-led procurement. This study fills this current knowledge gap and enhances the understanding of the specific costing challenges faced by contractors in contractor-led projects, leading to the development of 5D framework for use in future projects. Design/methodology/approach: To develop a fully detailed understanding of the challenges and issues being faced in this regard, a phenomenological, qualitative-based study was undertaken through interviews involving 21 participants from UK-wide construction organisations. A thematic data analytical process was applied to the data to derive key issues, and this was then used to inform the development of a 5D-BIM costing framework. Findings: Multi-disciplinary findings reveal a range of issues faced by contractors when implementing 5D BIM. These exist at strategic, operational and technological levels which require addressing successful implementation of 5D BIM on contractor-led projects adhering to Level 2 BIM standards. These findings cut across the range of stakeholders on contractor-led projects. Ultimately, the findings suggest strong commitment and leadership from organisational management are required to facilitate cost savings and generate accurate cost information. Practical implications: This study highlights key issues for any party seeking to effectively deploy 5D BIM on a contractor-led construction project. A considerable cultural shift towards automating and digitising cost functions virtually, stronger collaborative working relationship relative to costing in design development, construction practice, maintenance and operation is required. Originality/value: By analysing findings from primary research data, the work concludes with the development of a 5D BIM costing framework to support contractor-led projects which can be implemented to ensure that 5D BIM is successfully implemented. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The cost estimation model was developed using the system dynamics methodology by considering the influence factors for in-situ production of precast concrete members. The model was then applied to a real warehouse project to compare the costs of the quantity reflecting the field condition for in-situ production with those of in-plant production under the different scenarios with the available production sites within the construction site. The results of simulation tests indicated that the cost reduction of up to 16.9% was achieved from in-plant production to in-situ production when 100% of the precast concrete members are in-situ produced. When considering the field conditions of the real warehouse project site, the cost reduction of 13.9% was achieved in the site where in-situ production of precast concrete members is applicable within a limited space due to the production and yard stock areas. The model helps save production costs of the precast concrete members for project owners because it can estimate the actual in-situ production quantity and costs by varying the in-situ production areas compared to the construction site areas. © 2020, Iran University of Science and Technology."

The present study deals with the development of a scheduling tool to meet the requirements of projects having repetitive activities. Generally, the schedule of a repetitive construction project is made by using commercially available scheduling tools like Primavera and Microsoft Project. The link between 2D drawings/3D components and repetitive schedule is missing in these scheduling tools. The literature indicates the use of 4D modeling in case of non-repetitive construction projects to establish this link. In 4D modeling, a graphical simulation of the execution sequence is developed by linking 3D components with the schedule of a facility to be developed. 4D modeling tools lack in certain features such as generating/updating schedule, linking 3D components with schedule, and consideration of surroundings into a common platform. Geographic information systems-based environment has been explored in the present study for the development of the tool for repetitive scheduling, linking 3D components with the repetitive schedule, and to develop 4D model of the execution sequence of a repetitive construction project. 3D components developed for 4D modeling were also used for cost estimation. 4D model of the execution sequence and cost estimate together constitutes a 5D system for repetitive construction projects. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

However, the economics of a project and environmental safety are some of the key issues, that still need to be addressed. This research work focusses on the comprehensive assessment of the economic and ecological sustainability of bulk utilization of CCR in geotechnical applications. Physical, mechanical, and physicochemical properties of different types of CCR were determined and compared with locally available natural soil. The results reveal that all CCR samples were non-plastic, exhibited low sensitivity to moisture content, negligible crushing during compaction, and displayed significant shear strength (φ ≥ 30°). All CCR demonstrated an alkaline pH that satisfied the requirements of a fill material. The environmental risk associated with the application of CCR was assessed through leachability tests as per EN 124057–4 (2002). The results revealed that CCR is safe for disposal in inert landfills as per European Council Decision 2003/33/EC guidelines, due to low risk to the environment. The cost estimation suggests that CCR is comparably very economical if available within 5 km of a construction site. The findings of the study clearly revealed that the application of CCR is cost-effective as well as environmentally safe and a sustainable alternative to the natural soil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

However, corrosion in embedded steel due to chloride ingress causes durability problems, and this poses a threat to structural performance degradation. The repair cost is very important for the maintenance of RC structures, through which the service life can be extended with reasonable performances. Unlike the conventional deterministic evaluation used to determine repair cost, the probabilistic method can provide a more reasonable result that considers various engineering uncertainties and continuous repair cost. In this paper, the repair cost for an apartment near the seashore was evaluated based on the actual concrete mix proportions and repair unit cost. Two patterns of PSLF (probabilistic service life function) using normal distribution and log distribution were considered for the repair cost evaluation. This was done after the derivation of service life was calculated based on two mix proportions. Within a given service life, various repair costs were evaluated and discussed that considered concrete mix proportions, the pattern of PSLF, and conventional techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

It introduces a user-friendly interface, which ensures that the work is completed in the chronological order of the construction phases. The proposed QS framework offers a reliable and time-efficient estimation method, in comparison to other methods (i.e., human labor using paper or Excel), which was tested using real data and was validated by experts and consultant companies. Furthermore, it automated the reading of project information from construction maps, which reduced errors when estimating costs. It could also automatically determine the project location using Google Maps and could quickly guide the user to the location. The proposed QS framework automated the manual and Excel work of cost computing with an accuracy of 99%, reducing human calculation errors. It also effectively reduced the calculation time to only three days (compared to 114 days of manual work or 19 days of Excel work).

A Monte Carlo simulation was used to conduct research based on the data gathered from official reports over the past 10 years and semistructured interviews. The study found that the main influences on cost performance are the maximum number of working days per week, the minimum wage for a full-time worker, dealing with construction permits, an inefficient government bureaucracy, and the business costs of crime and violence. The outcomes illustrate that the effects of risk on cost estimations obey different probability distributions. 22 of the effects of risk on cost estimations followed a normal distribution, and 2 of the effects of risk followed a uniform distribution. The research determined that in international rail projects, different risks have different effects on cost estimations. The effect of the maximum number of working days per week on investment costs was substantial (11.6%–13.3%). The effect of the minimum wage for a full-time worker on investment costs was approximately 11.4%–13.1%. The effect of dealing with construction permits on investment costs was relatively lower (11.4%–12.8%). The results further suggest that the effect of all cost-estimating risks on the total investment costs of international rail projects is approximately 5.7%–12.9%. The study concluded that to achieve sustainable cost control, decision-makers should pay more attention to the effects of cost-estimating risks, such as the number of working days, workers’ wages and construction permits. The limitation of the research is that less effort has been made to assess the risk attitudes of international construction sectors. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Estimated savings yielded 20% of contract value using the schema, for the multi-million-dollar project case study, thus extending evidence of BIM savings and benefits. The schema improves the existing process and valorises clash detection, thus allowing stakeholders to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. In addition, the categorisation methodology allows prioritising on the most costly clashes, and draw lessons learnt for further projects. This schema opens the path towards a systematic methodology to appraise the benefits of different BIM uses or processes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The analysis was employed to determine design variables and economical aspects that needed to be considered in the distillation unit design. In this article, field data was obtained from the Biodiesel Plant, PT. Cemerlang Energi Perkasa, Plant 1, Apical Group Dumai, optimized as basis for calculating and assuming certain values or process variables in the preparation of this process system analysis. The degrees of freedom obtained for the distillation column, which has been reduced by the number of variables is C + 2. Through calculation of estimated cost, it is found that total value of fixed capital investment is $ 6,093,147.43 considering cost of main equipment of $ 1,594,230.10 as well as total direct cost value of the methanol/glycerin distillation unit of $ 3,905,863.75. Cost of the process operation is estimated at $ 234,615,524.6 with minimum product price of glycerin $ 3.39/lb.

However, it is not easy to carry out the initial stage with confidence, because information such as design books and specifications is not available. In previous studies, case-based reasoning (CBR) is used to estimate initial construction costs, and genetic algorithms are used to calculate the weight of the retrieve phase in CBR's process. However, it is difficult to draw a better solution than the current one, because existing genetic algorithms use random numbers. To overcome these limitations, we reflect correlation numbers in the genetic algorithms by using the method of local search. Then, we determine the weights using a hybrid genetic algorithm that combines local search and genetic algorithms. A case-based reasoning model was developed using a hybrid genetic algorithm. Then, the model was verified with construction cost data that were not used for the development of the model. As a result, it was found that the hybrid genetic algorithm and case-based reasoning applied with the local search performed better than the existing solution. The detail mean error value was found to be 3.52%, 6.15%, and 0.33% higher for each case than the previous one. © 2020 by the authors."

Therefore, construction companies have to conduct not only national projects but also international projects to be competitive. However, although these international projects can be profitable, the construction companies face many challenges in the management of these projects due to the country-specific problems and conditions. This can lead to variation in the management of similar projects conducted in different countries. In particular, cost estimation in different countries is a challenging task for construction companies. Therefore, in order to provide insights about construction cost in different countries, different organizations publish construction cost indices. However, some criticisms related to the reliability and usability of these indices are stated. In this study, a new concept, called a cost map, is proposed by developing a framework based on twelve macro level parameters. The cost map is applied to 37 European countries. The data related to these parameters are collected using different databases. European countries are clustered by using a self-organizing map. As a result of this study, the cost map is determined as a reliable and convenient tool for a cost comparison. © 2019, © 2019 Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers."

New collaborative contracting models are increasingly used to tackle this complexity and uncertainty. In a public context, collaborative contracting may be seen as an international trend in public policy, which is implemented in projects by public clients world-wide. Since a few years, the Swedish Transport Administration recommends that a two-stage Early Contractor Involvement should be used for very large and complex projects. This paper analyses the implementation of this model in two sub-projects in a large Swedish infrastructure project based on policy implementation literature. Altogether 24 interviews were performed in two rounds, capturing both early expectations and experiences gained after the contracts had been signed. Participants expressed positive attitudes to the new collaborative project practices. However, the implementation process was characterized by ambiguity and many issues about staffing, collaboration processes, target cost estimations, responsibilities and design output were left to the projects to resolve. The study shows how conflicting policies and high project-level autonomy combine to counteract organizational learning and homogenization of practices in this field. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

In addition to its basic role of providing shelter, the sub-sector contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product of both developing and developed countries, and plays an equally important role in the creation of employment. Unfortunately, unlike in the developed countries, the way building projects are often managed in developing countries has often led to the under- or non-exploitation of the potential of these projects. Many factors, including inaccurate and poor labour costing, contribute to the poor management of building construction projects which often leads to budget overrun. This paper aims to investigate the use of an ontology-based technology in modelling information about labour costs in order to facilitate decision making among housing developers. This is achieved by pursuing two objectives. Firstly, a rigorous review of literature is undertaken to identify the gaps in current labour costing practices in developing countries in general and Cameroon in particular. Secondly, an ontology rule-based system is developed to facilitate decision making and computation of labour cost in housing construction projects. © 2018 Esprit. All rights reserved."

Until the current mid-century, economic assessment of the aftermath of climate change in these regions was physicogeographically based on six model climate assessments of cryogenic conditions, reflecting the most negative (scenario RCP8.5) option of the IPCC global climate change forecasts, which best fits the conditions of the Russian Arctic. The data of Russia’s Transport Strategy until 2035, updated by the authors, serve as the basis for predicting road infrastructure development. An inertial (conservative) scenario of road infrastructure development in 2020–2050 shows that capital costs to maintain road infrastructure sustainability and reduce damage risks under permafrost thawing and degradation will average at least ₽14 bln a year and will exceed ₽21 bln and ₽28 bln, respectively, under the moderate and modernization scenarios. The maximum indicators will be relevant for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Magadan oblast, and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The implementation of the modernization scenario will require revision of the existing standards, technologies, and entire economy of the road infrastructure and capital construction favoring the development of innovative standards and construction technologies, as well as the improvement of the proposed methodology and methods of cost estimation for these purposes. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

However, along with that come severe challenges of high energy consumptions, massive resource wastes and serious productivity decline to the traditional AEC industry in China. Therefore, a technological concept named pre-fabricated construction is being highly embraced in recent years to help solve these challenges and meanwhile realize ""Lean Construction"" which is mentioned in the sustainable development of urbanization. This concept is proposed for decades, but its implementation in practice is facing technical barriers including lack of efficient management patterns, inefficient collaborations of stakeholders, outdated means of information collection and processing. To overcome these barriers and narrow the gap between the concept and practice, an emerging digital technology called Building Information Modelling (BIM) is suggested to accelerate the digitalization of AEC industrial management pattern and the implementation of efficient pre-fabricated construction. This paper aims to introduce an innovative framework for a digital management system that integrates the concept of five-dimensional (5D) BIM with the technique of radio frequency identification devices (RFID). This BIM-based system is developed in order to realize efficient management from off-site pre-fabrication stage to on-site assembly phase for pre-fabricated construction projects in China. It is also expected that 5D BIM can provide modeling, schedule simulation, and cost estimation to maximize the value of information flow for improving the productivity of pre-fabricated construction process. © International Conference on Smart Infrastructure and Construction 2019, ICSIC 2019: Driving Data-Informed Decision-Making."

An experiment was performed with 20 randomly selected test cases. The compensation costs were estimated based on damage days and excessive noise level of similar cases. A Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was adopted to deal with limited and uncertain data. The results showed that the cases had a similarity of 91.8% on average, and the mean absolute error ratio (MAER) of the estimated cost based on data revised by MCS was approximately 11.8%.

The results of the study were compared with the situation of cost estimation practices in the RA. The study reveals that for BIM technology and cost estimation incorporation, there are various barriers as local building codes, regulations, specifics of construction technologies, and common requirement of uniqueness for each erected building.

Digital building models to support the relevant processes in the construction value chain are increasingly being implemented in infrastructure construction. While the use of BIM are quite common in building construction, the design documents of infrastructure structures are still frequently prepared in 2-D. Even when the design is done in 3-D, properties are rarely assigned to the volume bodies. Only in this case it can be called a “BIM working method”. Another difference to the building construction is the much stronger interaction of the selected construction methods with the ground. This applies in particular to underground constructions, as the ground behavior during tunnel drive is primarily dependent on the chosen tunnelling method. Despite extensive exploratory measures, however, the geotechnical properties and the ground behavior are never completely known in advance. Therefore, 3-D-digital ground models have to fulfil special requirements in order to create with BIM-ground models a comprehensive basis for typical use cases such as the simulation and selection of the construction method, quantity surveys and cost estimation, real time monitoring of the ground behavior during the excavation phase. This paper shows a prototypical way in which a ground model can be created and processed in a BIM software. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved."

Conceptual cost estimation in feasibility study is require high accuracy and less validation error especially in construction projects at early stages. The more improvement of estimation techniques, it would lead to the lesser problems of cost overrun, and extra expenses. This paper developed a cost estimation model for new constructed rural road projects. Considering the estimation methods for predicting the cost model, parametric method based on regression learner and NN method are applied. Previously, many researchers studied the cost applicable model by using various computer applications, so that this paper differed to compare these methods based on MATLAB. Accordingly, 44 road projects were compiled from DRR database, after that identifying the effective cost parameters referred on collected data. Subsequently, the data implementation process was focusing with regression learner based on automated regression training, and lastly, with NN toolbox concentrated on nftool for simulating the cost models. Another 7 road projects are tested with holdout validation process for these models. Due to this validation, we compare the predicted cost models within these methods. Finally, the developed models are reliable for not only the conceptual phase of future rural road projects but also the related construction fields can be recovered about the cost model creation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

However, a major obstacle regards being able to estimate projects during their conceptual phase. Conceptual cost estimating occurs at the early stage of a project after order-of-magnitude estimates are completed. Detailed project information, however, is quite limited during this early phase, resulting in considerable uncertainty. In this paper, the application of decision support system technology is investigated. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are software systems that utilize sophisticated algorithmic approaches to solve problems. A suitable underlying predictive model, within the DSS, was selected to support the unique needs of university-related construction. This resulting system provides an automatic and user-friendly environment to support project budgeting, and make decisions among proposed project alternatives. The DSS contains two main components for data collection and data analysis. The data analysis component encompasses: (1) an estimating module predicting the capital cost of the project, (2) a quality assessment module determining the accuracy of the results from the first module, and (3) a support module that depicts visualization information for the decision-makers via a Graphical User Interface. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

As a result, the criticality of such lifts depends primarily upon the ground support health. The traditional approach is to make use of timber/steel mats for ground stability. The use of frozen silt (water and silt frozen mixture) as an alternative to this or to reduce the number of layers of timber mats is a novel technology that is explored in this work. For projects where this technology could be applicable, heavy construction companies will be able to avoid extensive ground preparation and reclamation by adopting this approach. The mechanical properties of frozen silt are comparable to timber mats (Coastal Douglas-fir), but are dependent upon the temperature constraint. This contribution encompasses the use of artificial ground freezing for the preparation of frozen silt matting for ground support. The required mat surface temperature is considered as −10 °C, based on the competitive mechanical properties for its practical use. The freezing process is investigated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Simulation is performed to obtain the bottom-up estimate of ground freezing using indirect freezing (brine chillers) and direct freezing (liquid nitrogen) for both the freezing phase and maintenance phase. The simulation is executed under three ambient temperatures (10 °C, 5 °C and 0 °C) in order to make it realistic. The results from these simulations can establish a baseline for cost estimation for the alternative crane matting solution in the form of frozen silt mat. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

All those harmful consequences and damages that third parties or the community sustain due to the implementation of construction processes are called social costs. Although, the presence of social costs is widely mentioned in the literature, in the projects’ initial cost estimation practices, the social costs are not estimated and included. Whereas since these costs are not compensated, problems can be emerged by the community. It is a truism that the majority of the models proposed to quantify the social costs have been concentrated on construction, repair, and maintenance of the infrastructure projects namely; utilities, roads, and highways. On the other hand, up to the present, a limited number of attempts has been made to quantify residential housing construction associated social costs. Thus, this research aims to expand and/or contribute to the existing body of knowledge via estimating how much social cost society surrounding residential housing construction sites are subjected to. For this purpose, a social cost estimation model is developed to assist industry professionals on how to estimate social costs in residential construction projects. The social cost estimation model is developed to provide guidance for phase by phase monetization of the residential construction associated social costs.

Then, the strength of the scaffold was confirmed and the quantity of the material was accounted.

In the proposed design method, the geometric design and the safety requirement were specified by the safety standard and the design flow was followed by the designer’s knowledge. The size and the quantities of the materials were calculated by referring to the relation between the scaffold and the constructing structure.

The approach includes identifying a reference reactor design (a standard PWR), for which detailed and defensible cost information is available, based on the U.S. construction experience. The main reactor components are then ranked in decreasing order of fractional contribution to the total direct costs of the reference PWR. By focusing primarily on the most expensive components, it is possible to tailor the algorithm to the desired degree of fidelity, at the expense of larger efforts for more robust estimates. Cost models have then been developed for each of the most expensive components, including, for each model, a description of the cost basis, and of the associated assumptions, approximations and limitations. The model developed in this work allows the identification of which cost components are likely to be more expensive and of which are likely to be less expensive, and by how much, for each alternative design studied, thus potentially providing insight into the cost drivers of various reactor technologies.

Adding flexibility in manufacturing processes can mitigate this uncertainty, but can also create costly solutions. This is particularly true when manufacturing facilities have long design and construction lead times. In these cases, manufacturers take risks by starting facility construction before the product development is complete to meet time-to-market needs. Similarly, uncertain market demand can create the need to build facilities with additional volume or the ability to expand. This paper presents an analysis of how manufacturing flexibility affects building system costs and proposes a solution for understanding the tradeoffs. The research method maps various types of manufacturing flexibility (e.g., process, routing, volume, etc.) to ASTM UNIFORMAT II building systems (e.g., substructures, shell, interiors, etc.). Based upon this mapping, initial cost models are proposed to explore the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and facility construction cost. The models are intended for use in the earliest stages of capital facility planning. These results will help manufacturing facility owners, designers, and constructors make informed decisions about how to build flexibility into their buildings at lower costs while mitigating for uncertainty and meeting time-to-market needs. © 2019 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2019.

The issue of user costs is closely related to decision making on investments in the transport infrastructure. Ability to define and properly estimate the user costs in the framework of road transport in general, while at the same time to find and include their local specifics promises to improve the above mentioned decision making process. The objective of this research paper was to assess the way of lowering these user costs by an alternative approach to the highway reconstruction - with the use of precast concrete pavements. Approaching this technology innovatively promises significant savings of the construction time and consequently the road user costs in comparison to the traditional cast-in-place construction method. Global experience and methods used for the road user costs' estimation were researched and analysed. Real data from a recently completed highway reconstruction project (using the traditional cast-in-place method) were used together with all the available data on socio-economic elements needed for the calculation. It led to an interesting and presumably generally valid result - road user costs, most often utterly ignored by the public investor, are more than double to those of the reconstruction itself. Comparison regarding the user costs' value of both before mentioned technological approaches to the highway reconstruction was then also performed. This led to the conclusion, that using the prefabricated pavements with their much shorter onsite construction period and lower road user costs results in a significant decrease of overall highway reconstruction costs. © 2019 Latvia University of Agriculture.

One alternative to achieve better energy performance in existing houses is retrofit. However, there are difficulties associated with retrofitting social housing. It is currently challenging to compare scenarios (retrofit options) considering costs, potential energy efficiency gains, and at the same time minimising disruption to users. This paper presents a Building Information Modelling (BIM) protocol aimed to support decision making by social housing owners. It adopts BIM to simulate alternative retrofit options, considering: (a) potential reductions in energy consumption, (b) 4D BIM for retrofit planning and reduction of users' disruption and (c) simulation of costs. A what-if scenario matrix is proposed to support decision making in the selection of social housing retrofit solutions, according to client and users' needs.

Then, we will demonstrate the BIM potential in real valuation as an emerging technology and process used to mainly improve the housing valuation system based on the hedonic approach. Many studies are, nowadays, widely exploring the use of BIM in the building cost estimation, but this is an embryonic area of research in real estate valuation system. Therefore, this paper examines also the first methodological guidelines for an advanced housing valuation approach by implementing a BIM prototype based on the hedonic pricing method. © 2019 WIT Press."

A high amount of expenditure is required for the construction of pavement structure. Due to increase in the magnitude of commercial vehicles, bituminous mixes are now exposed to greater stresses, and hence the performance of bituminous mixes is not good enough for paving applications. The present investigation, primly emphasizes to study the effect of filler materials and stress levels based on tensile strength on the number of load repetition sustained against the initiation of the first crack of a bituminous concrete mix. At controlled test temperature 25 °C, Indirect tensile fatigue test is conducted on bituminous concrete mix prepared using Stone dust and Cement as filler materials at 10%, 20%, and 30% stress level. Further regression analysis Based on the data obtained from Indirect Tensile Fatigue test and cost estimation per km for the construction of one kilometer of bituminous concrete mix prepared using both types of filler materials is carried out. As per the limited laboratory studies carried out, It can be concluded that no of load repetition varies with the addition of filler content and filler type. Fatigue life against the cracks decreases with an increase in stress level irrespective of filler materials. In the mathematical model Stress level and tensile stress are statistically significant with fatigue life, i.e., no of load repetition of a bituminous concrete mix. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In order to replace fossil-based polymers, photoautotrophically produced polyhydroxybutryrates (PHBs), which are intracellular carbon storage products of nutrient-deprived microorganisms, seem to be a promising, biobased and biodegradable alternative. Although laboratory and pilot scale experiments have already been performed, no economic evaluation has been carried out so far. Consequently, valid claims on PHB production costs and the influence of different parameters, such as intracellular PHB-content, choice of cultivation system or location, cannot be made. In this study potential demonstration plants, equipped with different photoautotrophic cultivation systems and located at two sites, were designed to identify key parameters for a successful economic realization and implementation. Material and energy balances were determined to reveal specific PHB production costs for four different scenarios. Raw material and operating supply costs, expenditures for plant construction and operation as well as product amounts were determined using literature data for specified results from laboratory and pilot scale experiments. The lowest calculated PHB production price (24 € kg−1) accomplished in a thin-layer-system plant located in Southern Europe with 60% PHB-content of the produced biomass is significantly higher than the current market price of heterotrophically produced PHB. The most important cost factors in all scenarios are cultivation and harvesting costs accounting for 62 to 72% of the total specific production costs, followed by maintenance costs with a cost share of 11 to 14%. Therefore, the choice of a suitable cultivation system is the key driving factor for an economic PHB-production due to the currently high investment costs for photosynthetic biomass production systems. Specific production costs for a Southern compared to a Central European location amount to almost half of the costs. © 2019"

The amount of risk costs of construction projects depends on various project parameters, among others on the construction output. Therefore, in this study the amounts of risk costs of 26 risks are determined for three categories of construction output (< 200 000 €, 200 000–1 000 000 € and 1 000 000–2 500 000 € construction output). Only building construction projects with a construction output ≤ 2 500 000 € and unit price contracts applying the VOB/B are considered. By the use of a deterministic risk cost calculation it was shown that both, the amount of the risk costs and the order of priority of the risks vary, depending on the amount of the construction output. Furthermore, a stochastic risk cost calculation applying the Monte Carlo Method is used to reveal the range of risk costs depending on the construction output. Through the consideration of the average of the three categories it can be pointed out that the risk costs – without taking chances into account – range between 2.71 and 8.67 % of the construction output. The results facilitate the contractor during the tender calculation to determine the amount of risk cost depending on the market situation, the company-specific risk disposition as well as strategic considerations. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn.

Term matching and natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used in the method to match items from a design model and automatically extract their unit costs from a cost database. These unit costs retrieved are then used in generating the cost estimates. The proposed method was tested on estimating a wood construction model retrieved online.

The building functions reviewed in this study are business function, socio-cultural function, and residential function. The independent variables consist of building area, building height, floors number, and project implementation time. On the other hand, the dependent variable is the total costs of the project. The data used as samples are as many as 155 and have been taken by using a probability sampling. Subsequently, the analysis of this study is performed by using a multiple linear regression method. The result shows that there is a difference in the estimated costs in each function, either business function, socio-cultural function, or residential function. When referring to the number of business function costs estimation, there is a difference by 32.01% for residential function and 21.9% for socio-cultural function. This means that both costs estimation for residential function and socio-cultural function are smaller than business function. This paper proposes a novel concept in the context of building cost estimation in Indonesia as currently the estimation merely depends on the size of the building without considering its various function. That way, the proposed view in this study will potentially change the way building cost is estimated in Indonesia.

However, the time and cost typically allowed for modeling are insufficient to extract accurate quantities throughout a project's life cycle. In addition, variations in quantity interfere with estimating accurate construction costs. Despite the recognition that extracted quantities can differ depending on the details of building interior components, the number and extent of discrepancies, or whether these would differ by material, is unknown. Therefore, this study identifies and analyzes the approximately 6-9% quantity discrepancy (QD) in quantities extracted from different building interior components, in order to improve the accuracy of cost estimation using BIM. The discrepancy was analyzed by comparing the extracted quantities via two different model types, specifically a compositely modeled object and an individually modeled object. These models were applied to four cases of interior work in residential units. Results indicate that the QD occurs non-sequentially and exceeds the loss rates for some interior materials. Furthermore, this study identifies the causative factors of the QD by common features observed in the particular materials and suggests modeling and measurement strategies for minimizing QD. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Design/methodology/approach: By using a questionnaire, data were collected from 201 project managers and engineers employed in different sectors in the oil and gas industry in Yemen. Findings: The survey analysis based on Kruskal–Wallis test method shows a high degree of agreement on the perceptions of risk factors depending on categories of companies. In other words, the tested risk factors exist in all sectors of oil companies in Yemen and are valid as a measure of risk factors in construction projects in oil and gas organizations in general. Although no evidence suggests that the risk factors differ significantly according to job title, the result of identifiable risk factors according to experience shows a statistically significant difference among participants in terms of their experience. The relative importance of the ranking of risk factors was obtained by the statistical analysis of responses on the impact and likelihood of occurrence of these risks. Findings show that internal risks are the greatest influential factors in construction projects in the oil and gas sector, followed by changes during construction project, government instability, incorrect project cost estimation, government delay in decision making, incorrect project schedule estimation, and political situation and war in the country.

The framework addresses the cost uncertainty associated with the detailed information that defines the BIM element properties. This cost uncertainty is due to the lack of available tools that address detailed QTO and cost estimation using solely a BIM platform. In addition, cost estimators have little experience in leveraging and managing information within semantic-rich BIM models. Unmanaged BIM element parameters are considered a source of uncertainty in a model-based cost estimate, therefore they should be identified and quantified as work items. A model-based system, which assists the estimators to conduct a QTO and cost estimate within the BIM environment, is developed. This system harnesses BIM element parameters to drive work items associated with the parameter�s host element. The system also captures the cost of scope not modeled in the design team�s BIM models. The system consists of three modules 1) establishing estimate requirements; 2) planning and structuring the estimate; 3) quantification and costing. This framework is supported by a computation engine built within an existing virtual design and construction (VDC) model review software. The Framework�s quantification and costing module was compared to existing methods in a case study. The outcome demonstrated improved cost estimate accuracy in comparison to existing BIM QTO computation platforms. This system provided a workflow for conducting a detailed cost estimate within the BIM model environment, instead of extracting geometric parameters to a spreadsheet. � 2019 Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

Construction-economic systems include building cost estimation, LCC calculation and facility management. The Czech construction sector is hampered by the diversity of these systems, despite the need for them to be interconnected and share data amongst themselves. For this reason, previous research has proposed a general connecting database to integrate data from the individual systems and effectively share them also within the framework of BIM designing. This paper generally describes further possibilities of expanding the connecting database to include another level. Specifically, this is demonstrated on one of the functional parts, i.e. the wall.

These include the waste of man-hours due to continuous requests for clarification by the computer scientist, or the transmission of partial or unverified information by the design team, or even inaccurate and approximate measurements based on 2D drawings. This can lead to lower levels of reliability of cost estimations with consequent design risks and the need for variants in progress, exceeding the project budget or the expected timeframe. The BIM approach can mitigate these risks, but it is necessary to define a planned and robust method that supports the consistency between the items of calculation and the elements of the model. This method needs to be based on a structured breakdown of the building and the activities necessary to the project, according to a clearly planned methodology. Therefore, it is necessary to define an approach capable of generating digital workflows and automatically updating quantities (especially in the event of changes to the project), as well as to ensure the correspondence between modelled elements and computation items, in order to have a consistent workflow and make immediate and clear the updating of information on each project document. The paper is oriented to the definition of a structure for cost planning process, which uses the experimentation of computer tools aimed at extracting the quantities directly from the model, allowing the automatic update in case of changes, through the use of a PBS (project breakdown structure), shared with the entire design team, and using a code system associated with the elements of the model, the calculation, but also to specialist reports, detailed graphics and schedules. © 2019 WIT Press."

Underestimating the capital cost in mining projects may postpone the construction and accordingly the production phases. In addition, overestimating the capital cost may decrease value of the project. Currently available capital cost estimation models cannot predict mining CAPEX in a reliable range of error. Since, current models are not considering all effective parameters other than capacity, annual ore production and waste stripping, they cannot turn out to a reliable result, although they can be used for a rough estimation of CAPEX. In this paper, to estimate the capital cost of mining projects, a model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is developed. To establish this model the technical and economic data of 52 open pit porphyry copper mines were collected. Robust design of this model led to negligible error of estimation of CAPEX anticipation procedure. According to the results, the capability of presented model to estimate the mining CAPEX in a wide range of mining capacity is proved. So, as a whole, with a view of evaluation results, this model can be used as a reliable model for estimating of mining CAPEX. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The estimate is simply based on the mean value, which is then manually adjusted by professionals using their knowledge and experience. A highway project is unique, and its price is highly dependent on various factors including location and the type of construction activities. A geospatial analytic method for project cost estimates would be highly useful for automated assessment of these influencing factors.

Furthermore, visualization plays an essential role in estimating, as the process begins with a thorough understanding of the project scope. Construction estimating is the process of projecting the total cost of a project and is considered one of the most critical processes in construction. The outcomes of this process are used to make crucial decisions throughout construction. With the information embedded in the model, the time and laborious work required for performing quantity takeoffs are substantially reduced. However, the visualization that BIM provides is in a two-dimensional computer environment which is neither immersive nor interactive. Virtual reality (VR) is a three-dimensional interface that allows project members to walk through a building model and interact with its elements in a virtual environment. This study presents a methodology that uses VR as a visualization technique to streamline the cost estimating workflow. A case study is then presented to demonstrate the workflow and capacities of an estimating system that creates quality, interactive estimates in VR. The results indicated that implementing VR in cost estimation reduces the time needed to complete the estimating process and facilitates the discovery of a variety of value engineering options that benefit all parties involved.

In order to maximize the site coverage ratio, the lower levels usually occupy most of the site area. Site planners generally agree that the availability of working space prescribes the level of complexity for site layout production planning (SPLP). It is also agreed that a confined site will bring about difficulties in planning and reduce site productivity. Generally, the spatial profile construction sites is classified in generic terms, such as sufficient, confined or congested. The degree of congestion could affect the selection of plant and machinery, construction method and work sequence. Various studies had been conducted to provide the effective use of site space, improve utilization of site space and positioning of plant and machinery. It is rare to find any studies that aim to quantify site space and explore its impacts on site planning. Such information would be useful for construction managers in reviewing SPLP in the tendering stage or project planning stage. In order to establish objective views on site spatial factor, unsupervised clustering using neural network techniques is used to classify site space conditions. The layout of buildings including site space, lower floors, high headroom areas and tower blocks is superimposed onto a standardized matrix grids and the spatial ratio between site space, site areas and building areas is calculated for analysis and clustering. Unsupervised clustering techniques namely, the K-Mean Cluster Analysis and the Self-organizing Map (SOM) algorithm are used to group the sample projects in terms of site spatial information and spatial ratios. The use of unsupervised clustering techniques and the objective data could assure the classification not predetermined and unbiased. Six site spatial groups are identified distilling sites from 'manoeuvrable' to 'congest'. Sample projects are selected from the spatial groups generated and their implications and constraints on site layout planning are discussed. The study will establish a new perspective to define the degree of congestion and their impacts on site planning.

We found that the unit construction cost of Japanese nuclear power plants rose during the period from 1975 to 1980, when the “improvement and standardization” programs took place, and did not increase or decline significantly after that. We also observed significant economies of scale, even if we take into account interest during construction, as well as the so-called overnight cost. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to analyze the total history of Japan's nuclear power generation until the Fukushima accident from the cost perspective. The findings could contribute to a better understanding of the economics of nuclear power, as similar studies in the United States and France tend to exhibit different results. The analyses in this study appear to reinforce the reliability of the cost estimation by the Japanese government, which has been used as the numerical basis for the current energy policies in Japan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Critical issues with these principles are how the cost targets are set, how shared profit is agreed upon and made transparent, and how production costs are steered towards the target costs and tracked. Research has shown positive applications of TVD, but also remaining challenges with the approach. This paper will focus on the process of setting the cost targets in TVD. In traditional design processes, the costs are estimated based on the finalized design. In TVD, design and construction is steered towards the constraints, while maximizing the value for the costumer. Based on the client value, Allowable Cost are set. In Scandinavian countries, stochastic cost estimation methods have been applied to estimate project costs and to set cost targets for projects over many years. The cost targets are set prior to detail design. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how stochastic estimates could be applied in TVD. The method used is a literature review, in combination with a case study of cost estimation principles in two Norwegian public agencies. Findings show that stochastic cost estimates could be used both as input to set Allowable Cost and to estimate the Market Cost. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

Recent evidence suggests building information modeling (BIM) is the commercial reality of today’s construction education, and the way of the future that has truly begun. Amongst the significance of this is BIM’s potential to revolutionize the industry. The purpose of this paper is to use the learning experiences of undergraduate students in two construction management subjects involving quantity measurement and cost estimation to explore students’ motivation toward BIM education. In particular, the study investigates decision factors underlying students’ selection of software for information management in a modeling environment. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 674 undergraduate students from the same institution were surveyed, out of which 153 responses were retrieved. The data provide insights into decisions taken by students while metamorphosing traditional processes into BIM-driven outcomes, in the form of commercial estimates of a real life project reported through a bill of quantities. Some 29 decision factors were analyzed. These include prior training, flair for creativity, ease of use, economic reasons, learning outcomes, on-going technical support and support infrastructure. Reductionist methods involving factor analysis and Cronbach’s α reliability estimate procedures were used to investigate the most important decision factors from amongst the decision factors analyzed. Findings: Results show all the 29 decision factors are statistically significant. Access to on-going support, the mandatory requirement to use a particular tool to complete an assessment task and the requirement to use the tool for job duties are the most significant decision factors. Vendors’ persuasion and the capability of the tool to achieve better outcomes than others are least significant. Statistical correlations between the decision factors were obtained. They all suggest near-absolute correlations. Practical implications: The practical implications of these findings are vital. They help to unravel factors that promote students’ interest in BIM education, and contribute toward the development of software selection models that are relevant to professionals and incipient businesses. Originality/value: Future studies on decision analysis can be built on the findings also. In particular, the decision factors help in developing creative cognitive solutions to BIM adoption issues. They also help on the challenge posed by the constraints of knowledge diffusion within and across project teams, and in designing tools that meet the requirements of non-design disciplines who also play vital roles in the BIM project environment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In the context of conventional BIM management, it is expected to get more detailed models as the design decisions developed. On the other hand, in the complex structure of project deliveries, where the construction phase is started and the design decisions are not completed yet, alternative procedures are required to manage outputs for both early and detailed stages of the design in the same model environment. In this chapter, the M9 Ikitelli-Ataköy underground line project was analyzed to decide the most proper scheduling workflows to generate survey reports of confined wall systems. While the length value is required to estimate cost alternatives of interior cladding, bill of quantities are going to be measured for calculation of surface area completed from the same model assembly. On the contrary, the system is assembled with both architectural and structural model elements, thus, the measurement data from length and area values cannot be pulled out to table list by default scheduling features of modelling software. When the BIM model elements hold the data, but those can not be inferred as required information, alternative information acquirement methodologies were reviewed and compared. During the study, the scope of BIM ontology was formed by such BIM platforms as Revit and its associated extensions Dynamo and Roombook.

These losses have been in terms of life and property. The elevated level of material destruction has also interested a large part of Italian Cultural Heritage, both as regards the monumental building and the movable goods. In fact, Italy is reach of many artistic goods which are not only allocated into Museums. The extended damage on older buildings such a Churches, which are not designed to resist earthquakes, is caused by different factors due overall to the construction techniques dissimilarity and the large variation of their construction typology. Still today Churches are the place where some of the most important artistical works are kept: paintings, frescos, statues, altars and other many sacred objects. During the emergency phase, a big recognition work has been carried out by the Civil Protection Department, as well as by all the Institutions which have been part of the recognition phase after earthquakes, collecting a database through the ""Schede AeDES"" which has been successively digitalized by the ""Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali e per il Turismo"" (MiBACT), able to gives for each building, the level of damage and the related real situation of intervention. The churches affected by the earthquake have been almost 3000 in the four regions. After the previous assessment on the field of their level of damage and of the related reconstruction's costs estimation carried out by expert volunteers technicians, on September 2017 the Italian Government have issued a funding plan for the reconstruction of the first 100 churches, chosen on the basis of the intervention's relevance. Moreover, many interventions of artistic goods rescue are made place thanks to the Fire Fighters, and successively by the MiBACT technicians. In fact, from the 2009 earthquake management experience, it was possible to face the scenario that struck Italy in the latest serious event in 2016. Thanks to the activation of a series of operations, it was possible to recover the huge historical and artistic Italian heritage constituted by many damaged movable goods. After the last seismic events, the technicians of special Units of the Ministry of cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MiBACT), has carried out a survey to map the damage of both historical buildings and movable artistic goods. From this survey, a damage scenario has emerged involving about 20.000 historical artistic a ssets and movable archaeologists, over 4500 linear meters of archival assets and 10000 volumes of books assets. When possible, the artistic goods are moved from the Churches, catalogued and hospitalized into specific warehouses. The recovery of movable goods, promptly activated by the MiBACT, has involved their removal from the damaged buildings and their subsequent placement in warehouses, even temporary, specially equipped and set up. These storages, managed by MiBACT, are able to guarantee the first activities of intervention for the stabilization of the artworks. In other cases, when was not possible to move the artistic works, a temporary structure has been built for the protection of the goods (such as frescos). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

Variations in construction cost disrupt transportation agencies in making right investment decisions and estimating accurate construction costs for projects. A wide range of variables has been proposed in different studies to explain variations in construction cost. There is value in conducting a research study that attempts to consider a comprehensive list of variables with potentials to explain the variations. The study needs to simultaneously take into account all possible explanatory variables to examine their relations with construction costs. The objective of this research is to assess the relations of several potential variables to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for major asphalt line items in highway projects. The primary contribution of this paper to the body of knowledge is the creation of a random parameters model to explain variations in submitted unit price bids for asphalt line items in highway projects. The identified variables used to build the random parameters model were classified into two major tiers. Tier 1 represents project-specific categories, including project characteristics, major supply sources for critical materials, and price adjustment clauses. Tier 2 represents global and external categories, consisting of the level of activities in local highway construction market, construction market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, and energy market conditions. It is expected that the findings of this paper will contribute to the current practice of cost estimation and investment decision making by helping transportation agencies develop more accurate budgets and contractors prepare more accurate bids for highway projects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Some of these hope to target net-zero carbon for new and existing buildings. As in most countries, the stock of existing buildings represents the bigger challenge for this target. In particular, existing affordable housing is the most challenging segment of the building stock. The limited access to expertise and financial resources makes it more difficult for owners of these buildings to retrofit them. Therefore, there need to be appropriate guidelines on how to achieve net-zero carbon in such building typology. This paper identifies both the technical and the financial challenges when trying to develop such guidelines within the context of the UAE. It also discusses the possible solutions that can be used to overcome some of these challenges. The technical challenges include the variation in construction systems, and the quality of construction for these buildings. It also includes energy modelling challenges such as selecting relevant weather data, and defining the patterns of using electricity for the different functions. The financial challenges include the subsidized price for electricity, the cost estimation for various energy conservation methods, and the payback for installing local renewable energy sources.

Three types of designs are compared, which are rubble stone masonry with a wooden roof structure, and concrete block masonry with either a wooden roof or with a steel trussed roof. An in-depth cost analysis and cost comparison was carried out, based on a unique collection of local building prices from 19 different villages, as well as generally applicable District Rates, all spanning a period of 10 years between 2007 and 2017. Master Estimates were divided into the 5 main building phases of foundation, walls, roof, floor and finishing, and then further broken down into local costs for materials, labor, and transportation. These cost comparisons give a detailed insight in the distribution of the costs, the pricing of individual materials and construction elements, the effect of price fluctuation on the total costs, and the cost implications of different solutions for seismic measures. It is concluded that the market prices, especially of locally sourced materials, fluctuate too much, making it impossible to detect useful patterns for general application or future predictions. Also, no similarities were found between the local village rates vs. the general District Rates, which insufficiently reflect variations at the micro level, such as availability of materials, site accessibility, or local preferences. To address these issues, the paper introduces a helpful tool for rapid cost estimation of different school designs. The last chapter analyzes the price implications of adding or removing certain seismic features. It concludes that improving masonry with cement mortar has the highest cost impact, but that inclusion of important seismic features such as horizontal bands, buttresses, and steel bars is not that expensive, meaning there is basically no financial obstacle to incorporate these in new constructions of schools and houses. However, all interventions require in-depth technical and scientific validation, for which the authors have started an initiative named SMARTnet.

A Risk-based Critical Path Scheduling Method (R-CPSM) that uses MRL is developed to calculate the duration of the project. A case study using a project selected from a previous study is used to compare the four estimation methods: two traditional PERT methods (3.2σs and 6σs), a Monte Carlo Simulation and the proposed MRL model. The results show that, compared with traditional approaches to estimate durations of uncertain activity, the proposed R-CPSM method is more systematic that can be combined with a cost estimation process and offers a rectification mechanism that dynamically monitors and adjusts the important factors that affect the risk duration.

Cost estimators are facing numerous difficult moments due to incomplete project details and unavailability of cost estimation instruments in early stages of a project. This issue uplifts the necessity of novel and advanced cost model which would be simple, understandable and more reliable. Within the Sri Lankan context, the accuracy of the estimated amount is solely based on the experience and skills of the estimator due to unavailability of reliable cost estimation tool for educational institution buildings in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this paper aims to discuss about the development of a computer model for cost estimation in educational buildings with the current practices and related issues in preparing preliminary project estimates. Semi structured interviews were conducted between twelve experts from consultancy and contractor organisations and the necessary cost data were selected from twenty educational buildings. The Multiple Regression Analysis and Artificial Neural Network methods were utilised to analyse the collected data. Each method has a unique way of building relationships between predictors and responses. However, both the methods were succeeded only in estimating cost of limited number of sub-elements. Multiple Regression Analysis succeeded on five occasions and Artificial Neural Network method had presented efficacy in seven sub-elements only. Altogether eight elements were succeeded in estimating the cost of an educational institution buildings. © 2019, Ceylon Institute of Builders. All rights reserved."

Despite its significant contribution to LCC, investors and construction industry practitioners tend to mostly rely on construction cost exclusively. Though the early stage estimation of running costs is limited due to the unavailability of historical cost data, several efforts have been taken to estimate the running costs of buildings using different cost estimation techniques. However, the prediction accuracy of those models is still challenged due to less quality and amount of data employed. This study, therefore, developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model for running costs estimation of commercial buildings with the use of building design variables. The study was quantitively approached and running costs data together with 13 building design variables were collected from 35 commercial buildings. The ANN model developed resulted in a 96.6% perfect correlation between the running cost and building design variables. The testing and validation of the model developed indicate that there is greater prediction accuracy. These findings will enable industry practitioners to make informed cost decisions on implications of running costs in commercial buildings at its early stages, eliminating excessive costs to be incurred during the operational phase.

The performance of a construction project requires serious management to achieve maximum results. Delays occur, quality is not in accordance with contract specifications, and costs that sometimes occur overbudget. Some studies show that the dominant factors causing overbudget in construction projects consist of: cost estimation factors, performance management factors, resource mobilization factors, control factors of timing performance, incomplete project information data, increasing material prices, and financial policies from government. In overcoming these dominant factors, project cost management is needed. Construction projects can be managed with project cost management. Project cost management includes the stages of planning, scheduling and controlling which are important steps to be taken to achieve the objective of project performance. Project cost management involves cost budgeting and cost control. Cost budgeting aims to generate a cost baseline to ensure project performance and project needs. A cost baseline is a time step from the budget used by the project manager to ensure and monitor costs. Cost control is used to monitor costs based on the cost baseline. Project control systems can be seen through project performance. Project performance can be done by comparing cost performance over time. Costs from the time period can be analyzed by variance analysis. Variance analysis involves actual project performance with planned performance. Value technique is used to analyze trend whether a performance is improving or deteriorating by comparing planned performance with actual performance. EVA (earned value analysis) is one of method using for project control. EVA method can be used to measure project performance which applied as a tool to integrate between cost and time aspect. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

The article presents the idea of determining technical wear of the construction, based on the detail analysis of the technical condition of balconies. Authors focus their attention to present possible aspects of technical wear of the building, especially considering external conditions influence on the construction. For this purpose, investigation was performed on the set of 74 balconies located in the block of flats in city of Poznań, Poland, where modernization is planned to be done within the next 12 months.

Consequentially, there is a need for effective construction waste management (CWM) at construction sites. This study seeks to define Building Information Modeling (BIM) dimensions and respective conceptual interactions that shape the integration of CWM with construction management. A multi-dimensional framework is proposed that leverages BIM-based automated construction waste (CW) estimation capabilities to provide guidance on CWM applications, specifically, CW disposal scheduling, disposal cost estimation, onsite reuse, and allocation of waste bins. The framework presents interactions between these CWM applications and construction management fields—scheduling, estimation, sustainability, and site planning—to enable a strategic alignment between conventional project objectives and CWM. To demonstrate the framework, a real-world pilot project is employed for the case of concrete waste. Data used are documented and tracked from the project and interviews. The results reveal a 5.3% difference between estimated and actual concrete waste quantities. Accordingly, the expected dates for scheduling concrete waste pick-up are estimated for proposed integration into the project schedule. The study estimates savings of over $35,000 from reuse and recycling. Construction activities related to a retaining wall—requiring backfill—are identified from the project schedule as opportunities for reuse. Findings reveal that waste bins could be dedicated to waste streams with high generation rates at each construction stage. Findings from this study would serve as a guide for construction practitioners in assessing key benefits of CWM in improving the scheduling, cost, and sustainability performance of construction projects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Time series data are collected for the analysis of six parameters generated in each segment ring tunneling cycle. These parameters are total thrust, torque, penetration rate, rotation rate, advance speed, and working chamber pressure. Bridging time series and the complex network with visibility graph algorithm indicates that all degree distributions of the construct networks follow the power law, establishing the scale-free time series of the parameters. Small-world features and hierarchical structures also indicate that the fluctuation and variance of the parameters are attracted, limited, or affected by a previous shield operation of segment rings.

As early as 1971, Schubert made a first contribution to the consideration of risks during the execution of building projects. In addition to that he was first to introduce elements of the risk management process to the construction management literature in Germany. By the use of an empirical study of the probability of occurrence and the cost amount by occurrence of risks, Schubert made among others a statement about the importance of the risks depending on the amount of the risk costs. More than 40 years later other results of the risk assessments are to expect. In an updated study for building construction projects with a construction output ≤ 2,5 million euros and unit price contracts applying the VOB/B primarily the altered risk assessments are shown; it needs to be emphasized that the sum of the determined risk costs correspond to Schubert's results. Furthermore, with a variation of the characteristic attributes (response options) of the probability of occurrence and the cost amount by occurrence of risks it can be displayed, that the risk costs during the execution of building projects are considerably higher. The updated results may serve as a benchmark for contractors during the determination of the risk costs in the tender calculation. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved."

A wide variety of artificial intelligence methods have been utilized in the prediction of the penetration rate of TBMs. This study focuses on developing a model based on deep neural networks (DNNs), which is an advanced version of artificial neural networks (ANNs), for prediction of the TBM penetration rate based on the data obtained from the Pahang–Selangor raw water transfer tunnel in Malaysia. To evaluate and document the success and reliability of the new DNN model, an ANN model based on five different data categories from the established database was developed and compared with the DNN model. Based on the results obtained of the coefficient of determination and root mean square error (RMSE), a significant increase in the performance prediction of the penetration rate is achieved by developing a DNN predictive model. The DNN model demonstrated better performance for penetration rate estimation compared with the ANN model and it can be introduced as a newly developed model in the field of TBM performance assessment. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Extended knowledge, wide-ranging information, substantial expertise, and continuous improvement are required to attain accurate cost estimation. Cost estimation at the preliminary phase of the project is always a challenge as only limited information is available. Hence, rational selection of input variables for preliminary cost estimation could be imperative. A systematic input variable selection approach for preliminary estimating using an integrated methodology of factor analysis and fuzzy AHP is presented in this paper. First, the factor analysis is used to classify and reduce the input variables and their variable coefficients are determined. Second, fuzzy AHP based on the geometric mean method is employed to determine the weights of input variables in a fuzzy environment where the subjectivity and vagueness are handled with natural language expressions parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, the input variables are suggested to be selected starting with those having high coefficient and high importance weight. A set of three variables, one from each group, can be added to the estimating model at a time so that the problem of collinearity can vanish and good accuracy of the estimate can be ensured. The proposed approach enables cost estimators to better understand the complete input variable selection process at the early stage of project development and provide a more accurate, rational, and systematic decision support tool. © 2019 Meseret Getnet Meharie et al."

Study results show that the generated route from the analysis has several advantages over the government preferred route while also having some shortcomings. The advantages of route analysis results compared to government preference routes include: better able to avoid earthquake and landslide-prone areas, better support to the preservation of protected areas, has more areas with flat to gentle topography, and have smaller additional construction cost as the consequences of the intersection with existing roads, rivers, and railways, In terms of affected land-use, generated route also has minimum negative impacts on the sustainability of agricultural land in the study area. The shortcomings of the analysis result are: not yet able to avoid flood and volcanic eruptions-prone areas as well as government's preferences route, higher land acquisition cost estimation, and less support for industrial and tourism activities in the research area.

This study identified a modified parameter-making process, which integrates many influential factors into a small number of significant parameters. The proposed model estimates the cost using quantity-based modified parameters multiplied by their price. A case study was conducted with 24-residence building project, and the estimation accuracy of the suggested method and a CBR model were compared. The proposed model achieved higher overall cost-estimation accuracy and stability.

The study adopted a quantitative research design using a structured empirical questionnaire survey. Also, a comparative analysis of the perceptions of the respondents’ groupings was conducted. The major barriers to BIM adoption are related to the inherent resistance to change by construction stakeholders, inadequate organizational support and structure to execute BIM, and lack of BIM industry standards in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the key benefits include better cost estimation and control, efficient construction planning and management, and improvement in design and project quality. Practical and insightful recommendations were suggested for policymakers, local authorities, construction firms, and other key stakeholders to increase the uptake of BIM in construction projects as well as to aid them in the quest for full adoption of BIM in the built environment.

The estimates are expected to be accurate, but there is a growing demand to shorten the time necessary to deliver cost estimates. The balancing (symmetry) between time of calculation and satisfaction of reliable estimation was the reason for developing a new model for cost estimation in construction. This paper reports some results from the authors' broad research on the modelling processes in engineering related to estimation of construction costs using artificial intelligence tools. The aim of this work was to develop a model capable of predicting a construction site cost index that would benefit from combining several artificial neural networks into an ensemble. Combining selected neural networks and forming the ensemble-based models compromised their strengths and weaknesses. With the use of data including training patterns collected on the basis of studies of completed construction projects, the authors investigated various types of neural networks in order to select the members of the ensemble. Finally, three models that were assessed in terms of performance and prediction quality were proposed. The results revealed that the developed models based on ensemble averaging and stacked generalisation met the expectations of knowledge generalisation and accuracy of prediction of site overhead cost index. The proposed models offer predictions of cost in an accepted error range and prove to deliver better predictions than those based on single neural networks. The developed tools can be used in the decision-making process regarding construction cost estimation. © 2019 by the authors."

While cumulative probability-based range estimates provide information about the level of uncertainty included in the estimate, confidence intervals provide information about the variability of the estimate. Such information could be very crucial for management decisions in early stages of residential building projects. Originality/value: This study could provide practitioners with a better understanding of the uncertainty and variability included in the cost estimate. Hence, they could make effective improvements on cost-related management approaches to enhance project cost performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Easy and quick assembly, as well as lower realization costs when compared to the traditional solutions increase interest in such structures. Availability and variety of systems allows for searching for solutions which are the best and optimal in the economical range. The article presents the comparison of costs of the basic materials used in various systems of flexible structures from the corrugated metal sheets. In order to determine the costs of the material solutions the data for two systems used in Poland (for construction of the upper passages for animals) since 2008 have been used. The cost estimation for the basic materials required for realization of 1 m2 of the flexible structure from the corrugated steel sheets have been prepared with use of prices obtained directly from the Polish contractors and manufacturers, as well as process included in the quarterly information (Sekocenbud). The difference of prices of materials available on the market allows the investor for selecting the structure depending on the needs and financial possibilities, as well as for achieving some savings. The savings in case of purchasing sheets of identical parameters (thickness, profile characteristics) are from approx. 4% to 8% per 1 m2 of sheet. The connectors in form of bolts M20 cl. 8.8 of various lengths are an expense from 3.00 PLN to 3.50 PLN. Those values may seem low, but taking into consideration amounts connected with construction of many square meters of structure they may become very important factor in the total investment costs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

This rapid assessment needs to occur as the disaster unfolds and immediately after the disaster, even while data is scarce and emerging. Marketing communication techniques and modern information technology methods (machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining) can help with these tasks. This paper shows how to use predictive modeling and geospatial interpolation along with machine learning for pre-disaster community planning, for risk management actions during the disaster, and for assisting in creating informed structure regulations to assist in disaster resilience. As disaster response is an ongoing process, the technique provides a framework of spatial level loss estimation using limited evolving data and iteratively improves estimation as more data becomes available. Predictive and probabilistic modeling starts with historical data (compiled before the event) including data such as damage to a specific building type as a function of water depth or wind speed. Topography of the land involved is assessed using satellite and LIDAR data and publically available flood maps created by FEMA for the National Flood Insurance Program and topographic maps produced in the US Topo project of the National Geospatial Program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). These baseline GIS datasets are overlaid with GIS-located data on building type and construction materials and usage scraped from county tax assessor websites. After buildings are GIS mapped, the FEMA’s HAZUS algorithm is used to estimate damages to each building as a function of projected area water depth. The water depth projection is determined by regression using wind speed and recurrence interval (i.e., Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017 was a 1 in 1,000 year event). As data becomes gradually available, we iteratively update estimates for areas using spatial interpolation. This informs communication modes of contact. To better assess impact area and population at risk with limited data, machine learning is applied. In disasters people often are active on mobile phones. GIS located text mining messages reveals who needs what and where, directs rescue, and improve damage estimates when data is sparse, and allow target messaging to vulnerable populations (Lazreg et al. 2016).

Further, the fluctuation of economic variables and indexes (EV&Is), such as liquidity, wholesale price index, and building services index, causes variation in costs. These changes may increase or reduce the construction cost, are hard to predict, and are normally ignored in the traditional cost estimation computation. This paper presents an innovative construction cost estimation model using advanced machine-learning concepts and taking into account the EV&Is. A data structure is proposed that incorporates a set of physical and financial (P&F) variables of the real estate units as well as a set of EV&Is variables affecting the construction costs. The model includes an unsupervised deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) learning approach along with a softmax layer (DBM-SoftMax), and a three-layer back-propagation neural network (BPNN) or another regression model, support vector machine (SVM). The role of DBM-SoftMax is to extract relevant features from the input data. The role of the BPNN or SVM is to turn the trained unsupervised DBM into a supervised regression network. This combination improves the effectiveness and accuracy of both conventional BPNN and SVM. A sensitivity analysis was performed within the algorithm in order to achieve the best results taking into account the impact of the EV&I factors in different times (time lags). The model was verified using the construction cost data for 372 low- and midrise buildings in the range of three to nine stories. Cost estimation errors of the proposed model were much less than those of both the BPNN-only and SVM-only models, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategies employed in this research and the superiority of the proposed model. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The requisite for efficient constructions that are often viewed in terms of concrete mechanical behavior, application on the field, and cost estimation of implementation increasingly require engineers to optimize construction materials, especially for concrete materials. Various types of concrete have now been developed according to their needs, such as high strength concrete. On high strength concrete design, it is necessary to consider several factors that will affect the reach of the quality strength, Those are cement, water cement ratio (w/c), aggregates, and proper admixture. In the use of natural mineral, it is important for an engineer to keep an eye on the natural conditions that have been explored. So the selection of aggregates as possible is a material that is not causing nature destruction. On this experiment the use of steel slag from PT.Growth Sumatra Industry as a substitute of coarse and fine aggregate, and volcanic ash of mount Sinabung as microsilka in concrete mixture substituted to create high strength concrete that is harmless for the environment. The use of mount sinabung volcanic ash as microsilika coupled with the use of Master Glenium Sky 8614 superplasticizer. This experiment intend to compare high strength concrete based slag steel as the main constituent aggregates and high strength concrete with a conventional mixture. The research result for 28 days old concrete shows that conventional concrete compressive strength is 67.567 MPa, slag concrete 75.958 Mpa, conventional tensile strength 5.435 Mpa while slag concrete 5.053 Mpa, conventional concrete bending strength 44064.96 kgcm while concrete slag 51473.94 kgcm and modulus of conventional concrete fracture 124.978 kg / cm2 while slag concrete 145.956 kg / cm2.

One way to optimize mode distributions is through strategically located freight transfer facilities, such as transload facilities. While there are many benefits to this type of facility, such as the emissions savings or pavement damage reductions garnered by shifting commodity tonnage onto alternative modes of transport, it is also essential that transportation planners understand the costs associated with building transload facilities. Unfortunately, literature does not provide an adequately disaggregated and scalable cost estimation approach that could be applied to various configurations and types of transload facilities. In this research, a cost estimation framework was created to determine the basic cost of transload facilities by type using unit costs from a construction cost database, equipment costs from local dealers, the projected commodity tonnage, design recommendations from literature, and survey responses from local facilities. A case study based upon proposed facilities in Arkansas was completed to illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology. While there is currently no construction design for these facilities, this framework yielded costs consistent with those expected. A key finding was that storage costs could account for up to 81% of a transload facility’s costs. Overall, this cost framework is believed to balance general scalability with accuracy well to provide reasonable cost estimations for constructing new or expanded facilities. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018."

We consider points X in a relaxed metric space, where the triangle inequality holds within a constant factor. A clustering of X is a partition of X defined by a set of points Q (centroids), according to the closest centroid. The cost of clustering X by Q is V (Q) =                             x                             ∈                             X                              dxQ. This formulation generalizes classic k-means clustering, which uses squared distances. Two basic tasks, parametrized by k ≥ 1, are cost estimation, which returns (approximate) V (Q) for queries Q such that |Q| = k and clustering, which returns an (approximate) minimizer of V (Q) of size |Q| = k. When the data set X is very large, we seek efficient constructions of small samples that can act as surrogates for performing these tasks. Existing constructions that provide quality guarantees, however, are either worst-case, and unable to benefit from structure of real data sets, or make explicit strong assumptions on the structure. We show here how to avoid both these pitfalls using adaptive designs. The core of our design are the novel one2all probabilities, computed for a set M of centroids and α ≥ 1: The clustering cost of each Q with cost V (Q) ≥ V (M)/α can be estimated well from a sample of size O(α|M|                             −                             2                             ). For cost estimation, we apply one2all with a bicriteria approximate M, while adaptively balancing |M| and α to optimize sample size per quality. For clustering, we present a wrapper that adaptively applies a base clustering algorithm to a sample S, using the smallest sample that provides the desired statistical guarantees on quality. We demonstrate experimentally the huge gains of using our adaptive instead of worst-case methods.

Though various models have been created to simulate the life cycle cost (LCC) and present value (PV) of GI investments, decision-support tools are still few. This paper introduces a probabilistic GI cost estimation algorithm built into the Low Impact Development Rapid Assessment (LIDRA) model. This algorithm tracks annual and cumulative costs associated with the construction, operation and maintenance (OandM), and ultimate replacement of GI systems. In addition, the algorithm accounts for uncertainties in cost drivers, such as a GI's useful life (until replacement), capital and annual O&M costs, inflation, and interest rates. Net present value (NPV) is used to normalize future money flows and cumulative costs of different GI investment scenarios into a comparable current year cost equivalent. Demonstrated at the block scale, the results of the LIDRA algorithm are compared to an MS Excel-based computation of average costs. Variations of uncertainties are then integrated and further explored using an alternative implementation rate. This algorithm is a way to evaluate GI costs considering physical, socioeconomic and life cycle dimensions. © IWA Publishing 2018."

The current discussions concerning the method of Building Information Modeling (BIM) are driven by visionary and idealistic approaches. The emphasis is placed on the opportunities offered by the model-based documentation and exchange of project data in the entire project life cycle. On the one hand this vision is important, because only the promotion of numerous advantages of alternative und collaborative methods will lead to a necessary change in the construction industry. On the other hand these big pictures of future project realisation methods leave the impression that those ideas have nothing in common with the actual situation in construction projects. However especially general contractors try to benefit from the use of digital methods and generate own 3D-models for the cost estimation – independent of existing structures. In this report the current practice of a modelbased tender phase will be described to emphasise the special view oft he construction companies and the resulting advantages.

To address the deficiencies of CPM, Location Based Management System was developed. LBMS takes repetitive locations as the computing unit and containers of project elements, through which resources flow in sequences. By incorporating multiple theories and methods in lean construction, it is continuous production that is highlighted in LBMS. To achieve the goal, LBMS needs to collect detailed project data at specific location level, e.g. room and corridor to support related calculation. LBMS by now are mainly used for schedule and costs estimation. However, with the rich data, the potential of LBMS to better accommodate the attributes and interactions of dynamic project elements, e.g. labor, materials and drawings have not been adequately exploited. Fortunately, the current deficiencies can be addressed by applying computer simulations. This paper first introduces LBMS and mainstream simulation methods; then develops a framework that integrates Discrete Event Simulation, System Dynamics and Agent Based Model into LBMS. The framework is formed by a database, a simulation engine and a demonstration tool, which aims to improve decision making by taking individual attributes and interactions and risky processes into consideration. Finally, a case study is introduced to demonstrate how the proposed framework works. © Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, CRIOCM 2017.All right reserved."

Estimation and costing is estimating the amount of material to be used and also calculating the approximate budget required for construction. Calculating the amount appropriately is very important to manage the costing. This estimation and analysis is mostly done manually. Maintaining high accuracy is very difficult at human level and even a small human error can cost a huge loss. Hence to eliminate the human errors and to enhance accuracy we are proposing a model in intelligent system. In this mode, input will be in the form of AutoCAD drawings (.dwg) from which dimensions will be extracted and converted to proper unit and will be used for calculation. This will reduce the human intervention to a large extent, thus minimizing the errors. The proposed model will estimate the amount of material used during construction such as sand, cement, concrete, bricks and all other materials and also will calculate real time cost, i.e. the total cost required to be spent on the material. Also the model will have a live database that will take input from the user, the real time costing of the material. The algorithm used will calculate material estimation and also the total cost for the materials, based on the dimensions extracted and quantities estimated. Hence the proposed model can help to eliminate human error while calculating estimates and can be used by a Contractor or a Builder to calculate total estimated cost and present it in the form of a detailed report which can be used for tendering purpose and negotiating a fruitful contract. © 2018 IEEE."

Economics is a basic requirement of the piled raft foundation design. The piled raft foundation cost estimation consists of two tasks: the material quantities and the construction labor, and its assembly include three tasks: installation, reinforcement and concrete. In this paper, piled raft construction cost is the objective function and the piled raft design parameters such as: allowable settlement, allowable differential settlement and maximum moment of the raft, are the performance indices. The design procedure in this study was obtained through two stages. At the first stage, different pile configurations were considered and the pile length, diameter and the space were changed for obtaining equal construction cost in all pile configurations. At the second stage, performance indices for each pile configuration were calculated. Each pile configuration has a maximum performance index, which is the optimum pile configuration. Sensitivity of the studies on the pile raft cost shows that, for typical pile raft foundation design, pile spacing and configuration are the key parameters in economic design. In general, it is recommended that, according to a given applied load (amount of load and load type), the optimum pile configuration method should be used in combination with a reasonable increasing of the pile length and/or pile positions to achieve the best possible behavior of the piled raft foundation. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Proper selection and accurate performance estimation of RBMs are two main parameters that affect the cost estimation and planning of the mining and construction projects. This paper aimed to suggest new empirical models for estimation of performance and operational parameters of RBMs in reaming operation by using simple (linear and non-linear) and multiple (linear and non-linear) regression methods. Balya lead-zinc underground mine was visited to investigate excavation of the ventilation shaft with a RBM. Length and diameter of the excavated ventilation shaft are 331.36 m and 2.44 m, respectively. Core samples obtained from the closest borehole to the fifth ventilation shaft in Balya lead-zinc underground mine were tested for defining some of the basic physical-mechanical properties. In addition, operational and performance parameters of the RBM were recorded/calculated during field studies. The results of field and laboratory studies were used in a statistical analysis to develop new empirical models for estimation of performance and operational parameters of the RBM. The results indicated that the uniaxial compressive strength might be used for estimation of rotational speed and consumed reamerhead torque. Moreover, Brazilian tensile strength with static elasticity modulus could be good estimators for field specific energy. However, accuracy and reliability of the proposed models should be improved by additional rock types and RBMs with different sizes and capacities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Their unique geometry enables to transfer the loads along a curved path to supports; a simple yet a quite robust mechanism. This distinctive characteristic makes arch bridges one of the most popular bridges of all times. For the present project, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) needs a bridge to carry pedestrian/bikers as well as vehicular traffic over a water stream that passes through a scenic valley/woods. The project investigates two superstructure alternatives; a Bow-string concrete arch and a side by side CPCI Box Girders. The first phase of the project (preliminary design) includes a simplified analysis, design and quantity/cost estimation of each alternative. A comparison is performed considering various aspects such as cost, durability, aesthetic and traffic impacts. Due to the highly aesthetic requirements of a landmark structure, the arch bridge is favoured. The second phase (detailed design) focuses on refinement of the applied loads and analysis to provide detailed design and drawings. In order to optimize the design and construction cost, a post-tensioning system is introduced to the arch tie girders. Such unique approach improves the bridge stiffness and induces both compressive stresses and upward deflection (camber) in the structure. This significantly reduces the tensioning/cracking and the final bridge deflection. In other words, it lessens the long-term repair/maintenance cost and improves the appearance of the bridge. The present paper details the design approach to optimize the cost along with improving the aesthetics, performance and sustainability of the subject bridge. � 2019 Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

For the purpose of project pre-feasibility assessment, methodologies are proposed according to the tunnel construction method, conventional tunneling (NATM), or mechanized tunneling (TBM). For both cases, statistical analysis tools in conjunction with stress and strain calculations are used in order to assess the volume of tunnel support. It is suggested that for TBM tunnels, the Probability of Failure is adopted as a failure criterion, and the volume of support computed accordingly. For NATM tunnels, a fixed Factor of Safety should be used in order to predict the support distribution and resultant support volume.

The temple was established in 2475 B.E (1932 A.D.) and covered the area of 0.25 sq.km. (134 rai). It is a significant center of spiritual and religious practices for the surrounding local communities. The temple nourishes the natural landscape and traditional architecture building. Up to date, new technology takes part in renovation and preservation of historic temple processes. A 3D laser scanning can play an important role in the renovation and preservation of historic architecture. It can be expanded beyond the traditional dependence on 2D representations. The products from 3D laser scanning can be integrated into commercial Building Information Model (BIM)/ Computer Aided Design (CAD) and modeling applications that can be used from initial concept, throughout the design process to construction drawing. This paper discusses how 3D laser scanning is used to record the temple features and its 3D point cloud data set can assist the architect exploring potential alternative design. The design solutions can be established within an accurate framework. Along with cost estimation can be calculated in the renovation process. 3D models built from laser scanning data set ultimately improve the quality and understanding of a planned design for architectural reconstruction.

Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy logic, combined with artificial neural network method (fuzzy neural network) was then used to develop an estimating model to aid the pre-tender estimation process. Findings: The results showed that the model is able to shift the cost estimation toward accuracy.

When designing new buildings or complex renovations using BIM, the benefits have already been repeatedly published. The essence of BIM is to create a multidimensional geometric model of a planned building electronically on a computer, supplemented with the necessary information in advance of the construction process. Refurbishment is a specific process that combines both - new structures and demolished structures, or structures that need to be dismantled, repaired, and then returned to the original position. Often it can be historically valuable part of the building. BIM-based repairs and refurbishments of the constructions, especially complicated repairs of the structures of roof trusses of immovable heritage listed buildings, have not yet been credibly presented. However, the use of BIM tools may be advantageous in this area, because user can quickly response to the necessary changes that may be needed during refurbishments, but also in connection with the quick assessment and cost estimation of any unexpected additional works.

However, conventional estimation methods deal with renovation projects similar to new construction and do not effectively consider potential risk factors. Thus, unexpected problems can make it difficult to proceed with the initial project execution plan. A three-phase framework is proposed for a probabilistic cost estimation process model that reflects the uncertainties of residential building renovation: (1) roughly estimating the cost based on industry means data; (2) converting the estimated costs to probabilistic values to consider the project characteristics; and (3) adjusting the converted probabilistic values according to risk factors. The value at risk of a specific construction can then be calculated to improve the reliability of the cost estimation. The proposed model was applied to a case study to demonstrate its feasibility. The results showed that the distribution of cost estimates reflecting the project characteristics and risk factors could be objectively confirmed at the initial stage. Thus, the method can help facilitate the decision-making process for homeowners, especially those reluctant to choose renovation. © 2018, Architectural Institute of Japan. All rights reserved."

Designing in accordance with the principles of sustainable development has an impact on the costs of construction works. The authors of this paper proposed an approach to estimate the costs of sports field construction using the Case Based Reasoning method. In their analysis, they distinguished 16 factors that affect the cost of a construction project and are possible to already be described at an early stage of its preparation. The original elements of the work include: consideration of such environmental factors as the environmental impact of the building, materials used, the impact of the facility on the surroundings affecting the amount of implementation costs and development of own database containing 143 construction projects that are related to sports fields. In order to calculate the similarity of cases, different calculation formulas were applied depending on the type of data (quantitative, qualitative, uncertain, no data). The obtained results confirmed that the CBR method based on historical data and using criteria related to sustainable development may be useful in cost estimation in the initial phase of a construction project. Its application to the calculation of the costs that are related to the implementation of sports fields generates an error of 14%, which is a very good result for initial calculations. In the short run, such factors as the impact of the object and the type of materials that are used from the perspective of their influence on the environment may be decisive as far as the costs determined in the life cycle of the building are concerned, as well as the lowest costs of the building construction ensuring the appropriate quality and respect for the environment. © 2018 by the authors."

There are several benefits of MUTs compared to buried utilities. However, MUTs are not widely used at the time being due to the high initial construction cost and the need for coordination among utility owners. Building information modeling (BIM) is becoming the main coordination tool for building projects. BIM has been extended to civil infrastructures, such as bridges, roads, and sewer networks. However, BIM extension for MUT information modeling (MUTIM) is yet to be developed. This paper aims to investigate a method for extending BIM to MUT projects taking advantage of similar developments for other infrastructure systems. In addition, a systematic approach for MUTIM use cases is proposed. Five use cases of MUTIM were mentioned in this paper: (1) design review for checking compliance with standards and constructability; (2) 3D coordination for clash detection and resolution; (3) ergonomic design for human accessibility and comfort during construction, inspection and maintenance activities; (4) phase planning for construction and maintenance scheduling using 4D simulation; and (5) quantity takeoff for cost estimation. The first two MUTIM use cases are discussed in detail. A case study is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The presented MUTIM approach can improve MUT projects design and coordination efficiency, and reduce project cost, which are the main barriers for promoting MUTs. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Although many works are found in non-food distribution, food-based logistics is less studied in an urban context, and sustainability issues of urban food systems remain little analysed, but it is a crucial element for local public authorities. This paper proposes a methodology for assessing scenarios of advanced urban food logistics; more precisely to answer the question of how school canteen distribution scenarios can be assessed in an economic and environmental viewpoint. Methods: To deal with those issues, the paper proposes to develop a scenario assessment framework combining a demand estimation model, a transport supply estimation method and a set of evaluation indicators (for both economic and environmental impacts). The demand estimation model generates first a number of meals per canteen then transforms it into a food quantity, based on carrier’s information and other practice’s feedbacks; the transport estimation is made with a combination of route construction algorithms that reproduce the logic of current Transportation Management System (TMS). The economic evaluation is made via direct operational costs estimation (both fixed and variable) and the environmental evaluation using COPERT V for direct emission’s assessment. Results: Three scenarios are assessed: the current situation with the operational warehouse, the use of an alternative platform in another location and the combination of both. To address the application issues, the proposed framework is compared to the use of disconnected commercial tools on the three scenarios. We observe that the first two scenarios are close in terms of travelled distances, times and costs. The third scenario, which involves two platforms, results on higher distances and times, and consequently on higher costs and higher for some of the environmental emissions. That scenario does not allow, with the considered demand, economies of scale (i.e. using less vehicles or in a more consolidated way). When comparing the two assessment methods, the proposed framework results on slightly higher travelled distances and times, but the same number of vehicles. However, results can be considered equivalent since the gap between the two assessment methods is in general around 5% for most indicators. Conclusion: It can be observed that the location of the platform is a key element, not only related to travelled distances, but also to the infrastructures used and their accessibility to the delivery destinations. However, this first assessment shows the interests and opportunities of food city supply solutions and merits further developments. The proposed framework allows to assess food distribution scenarios representing current practices, and would be extended to represent different alternatives of food distribution. Urban logistics is a subject that interests both city planners and researchers. Although many works are found in non-food distribution, food-based logistics is less studied in an urban context, and sustainability issues of urban food systems remain little analysed, but are a crucial element for local public authorities.

However, if the risk management is not discussed from the starting of the project, this duty is notably complicated and no longer efficient. This paper presents the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in project planning risk management. The objectives is to identify the traditional risk management practices and its function, besides, determine the best function of BIM in risk management and investigating the efficiency of adopting BIM-based risk management during the project planning phase. In order to obtain data, a quantitative approach is adopted in this research. Based on data analysis, the lack of compliance with project requirements and failure to recognise risk and develop responses to opportunity are the risks occurred when traditional risk management is implemented. When using BIM in project planning, it works as the tracking of cost control and cash flow give impact on the project cycle to be completed on time. 5D cost estimation or cash flow modeling benefit risk management in planning, controlling and managing budget and cost reasonably. There were two factors that mostly benefit a BIM-based technology which were formwork plan with integrated fall plan and design for safety model check. By adopting risk management, potential risks linked with a project and acknowledging to those risks can be identified to reduce them to an acceptable extent. This means recognizing potential risks and avoiding threat by reducing their negative effects. The BIM-based risk management can enhance the planning process of construction projects. It benefits the construction players in various aspects. It is important to know the application of BIM-based risk management as it can be a lesson learnt to others to implement BIM and increase the quality of the project. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

Most of construction heavy equipment and tools carry out activities in the form of repetitive cycles (e.g., a cycle of digging, swinging, loading). Precisely estimating cycle times for those operations is a crucial step toward productivity analysis, cost estimation, and scheduling of a construction project. The traditional approaches for estimating cycle times of construction cyclic activities are twofold: (1) based on direct observations and recordings; and (2) using available graphs and approximate formulas for estimations. The first approach is time consuming and labor intensive and the second one might not be sufficiently accurate and realistic. To tackle the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes an automated, Bayesian system for estimating cycle times of construction heavy equipment. Considering that construction equipment usually produces distinct acoustic patterns while performing various tasks, the main input for the system is recorded audio data. The presented system includes a de-noising algorithm for enhancing the quality of audio data as well as a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and support vector machines (SVM) for classifying various activities in a primary stage. A Markov chain model for activity transitions is calculated from ground truth data and used to code an adaptive filter that converts SVM-labeled time-frequency bins into higher-level labels of the full period for each activity. Preliminary results show that, through this system, the accuracy of predicting cycle times could be as high as 90%. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved."

The temple was established in 2475 B.E (1932 A.D.) and covered the area of 0.25 sq.km. (134 rai). It is a significant center of spiritual and religious practices for the surrounding local communities. The temple nourishes the natural landscape and traditional architecture building. Up to date, new technology takes part in renovation and preservation of historic temple processes. A 3D laser scanning can play an important role in the renovation and preservation of historic architecture. It can be expanded beyond the traditional dependence on 2D representations. The products from 3D laser scanning can be integrated into commercial Building Information Model (BIM)/ Computer Aided Design (CAD) and modeling applications that can be used from initial concept, throughout the design process to construction drawing. This paper discusses how 3D laser scanning is used to record the temple features and its 3D point cloud data set can assist the architect exploring potential alternative design. The design solutions can be established within an accurate framework. Along with cost estimation can be calculated in the renovation process. 3D models built from laser scanning data set ultimately improve the quality and understanding of a planned design for architectural reconstruction. A proposed renovation of the Watpasatharuam temple provides a case study illustrating how data derived from 3D laser scanning can form the basis of an accurate 3D model which can be integrated seamlessly into the architectural design process. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

Numerous reasons underpin these situations. One of the most important reasons is the cost-estimation failure. The cost estimation is the key contractual point and mainly depends on a weight estimation of the FPSO topsides. Because the topsides contain a lot of equipment and complex structures, it is very difficult to make an estimation at the contractual stage. To overcome this problem, many methods have been proposed to estimate the weight of offshore topsides; however, most of the methods involve the top-down approach, making it difficult to obtain a sufficiently accurate prediction for field-work usage in terms of the weight estimation. Therefore, a work breakdown structure (WBS) for the performance of the weight-estimation process is proposed in this study. Using the WBS of the FPSO topsides, the corresponding presentation of the weight-estimation process makes the process usable in the field work regarding the WBS-item estimations. Accordingly, estimates of the detailed units (disciplines, modules, and areas) inside the topside that were previously not possible were performed.

This research shows how cases can be generated and retained as learned cases to overcome the difficulties of continuous updates in a wide range of construction projects, as well as why the case bases need to be continuously updated. The research outcomes could support work related to cost estimation for decision makers ranging from beginners to experts in both academia and industry. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

It can be classified either as traditional or non-traditional depending on the cost variables formulation. However, in the building industry, quantity surveyors traditionally estimate the initial cost of building projects using the traditional models, which have been criticized overtime for its inaccuracies. This paper therefore aims to examine barriers for the utilization of non-traditional cost estimating models. Design/methodology/approach: By using a questionnaire survey, respondents were invited to rate their level of agreement on 23 barriers identified from literature and interview (expert’s opinion). Findings: Based on factor analysis inefficient techniques, perceptions of model techniques, unavailability of cost data and lack of understanding and unstable economic conditions were identified as barriers to the utilization of non-traditional cost estimating models. Practical/implications: Findings demonstrate that there is need for quantity surveyors to get adapted to utilization of non-traditional cost models which offers better accuracies than the traditional approaches in their quest to improve their professional practices. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that there are barriers to the utilization of non-traditional cost estimating models in the Ghanaian construction industry, as evident of this will help in policy formulation for the improvement cost estimating practices. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Due to pending issues regarding land acquisition, many construction projects have not been finished as well as financiers have been unable to pay their outstanding debts. Land acquisition is a very complex issue, although the government has overcome this problem with a regulation that land costs are under the state budget. In the case of Indonesia, land costs are operated by the State Asset Management Institution (SAMI) under the Ministry of Finance. In fact, land funds from SAMI are very late and land cost estimation is always under the actual land price. Therefore, the government asks the toll road company to bail out the land cost, and then the government will pay it the next year. However, investment costs can far exceed the original costs because land acquisition problems are still complex, and that price can be multiplied up to 10 times higher. This paper aims to analyze the unpredictability of acquiring land for toll roads by applying uncertainty management with a crystal ball simulation. A system dynamics simulation in using program uncertainty of toll road land acquisition validates it. In the case of Indonesia, it shows that the land acquisition cost increase is 30.2%, and the IRR is 0.01. Meanwhile, if a land lease is used, the revenue from the land lease can be a grace period in 2041, an IRR of 0.015, and a difference of 0.5%. © IAEME Publication"

This challenge could significantly influence project performance and its ultimate success. To yield accurate cost estimates, a successful estimator needs to have expertise in converting the early scope of the project into costs and also visualizing completed facilities from the construction documents at different levels of project progress. Therefore, to achieve the required cost estimation and cost management skills, STAs should organize specialized trainings for both junior and senior cost estimators at different levels. However, very little cost estimates development training or guidance is nationally available, and most STAs have developed their own estimating processes based on history, experience, and available resources. As a result, this study aims to develop national cost estimating and cost management training and also assess transportation junior and senior cost estimation workforce training and education needs.

Since wood is too expensive for local people, concrete becomes the major construction material instead. However, wood is considered a sustainable material that is eco-friendly, recyclable, and has less of an environmental impact than concrete. In this study, an innovative and cost efficient waste-wood composite structure was proposed with the intention of fulfilling local demand for the construction of traditional wooden houses, as well as supplying a sustainable and cost-efficient wooden product in the construction sector. Four small pieces of waste wood connected with steel nails or self-tapping screws were assembled into a rectangular waste-wood composite, serving as secondary beam, column, or brace. These waste-wood composites are considered recyclable and low-cost, and provide an alternative solution for local people that achieves an affordable and sustainable construction system. The assembled wood components were tested under single shear in order to clarify the structural performance of connection and the failure modes. The comparison of the experimental results and predicted results showed that the predicted strength is considered in a conservative manner for further application. In addition, the cost estimation and comparison between a solid wood structure and the waste-wood composite structure indicated that the price of the waste-wood composite structure is potentially competitive and cost-efficient for the local people, which was optimistic for future development. © 2018 by the author."

Flexible or rigid pavement construction generally do not reach designed service lives, either due to the fact that the construction do not meet specifications or unavoidable excessive load. Precast and prestressed concrete system has been applied since 2007, but unfortunately the application has not been optimum due to the fact that the construction method is not integrally carried out. This paper deals with a construction concept that developed in 2015-2017. The concept applies green construction based on integrated manufacture industry, starting from design, construction, function, maintenance and demolition. The concept is applied on the three highway sub-layers, i.e., sub grade, sub base, and surface, and drainage system. Sub grade improvement may use soil dislocation, chemical improvement or concrete matress. Sub base material uses foam mortar, which is material easy in quality control compared to conventional materials. Pavement material uses precast and prestressed concrete components with controlled quality, quickly function as flexible pavement, and moreover, may anticipate excessive loadings. Cost estimation is carried out integrated by life cycle cost: initial investment, obstruction while construction, and maintenance cost during operation.

Within the planning sector and the timber industry, the call for an early integration of specific information referring to timber construction aspects increases constantly. To this end, implementing methods of an integral planning process such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) seems to be a feasible solution. The existing planning equipment and design tools, the data on building components and processing technologies offer great possibilities for the large-scale implementation of BIM in the timber industry. Today's planning methodology commonly used in construction is based on formal concepts with the successive integration of designers and experts following the construction sequences from general into detail. This traditional approach dictates the methods of today's construction design. However, the probability of information loss through a step by step planning phase is extremely high as the degree of information within a building's construction increases significantly. To be able to investigate the requirements and constraints for an integrated planning process in timber construction, an expert survey was conducted in 2016. According to the experts' opinions, the integration of consistent data and information workflow in the planning process enables a traceable and transparent planning process, precise cost estimation and increasing planning quality. Among others, these arguments are confirmed by the majority of existing surveys as well as direct expert consultancies. Following the expert survey, timber construction systems with a high percentage of prefabrication are considered to be ideal for the vast implementation of building information modeling and management. The identified criterion and surveyed fundamentals of industrialized serial building systems can be transferred into general planning management methods. Additionally, the applicability was analysed in order to determine the potentials to generate appropriate design systems for timber construction. © WCTE 2018 Committee."

This process involves a wide range of uncertainties, which make it a challenging task. Because of unknown issues, using the experience of the experts or looking for similar cases are the conventional methods to deal with cost estimation. The current study presents data-driven methods for cost estimation based on the application of artificial neural network (ANN) and regression models. The learning algorithms of the ANN are the Levenberg–Marquardt and the Bayesian regulated. Moreover, regression models are hybridized with a genetic algorithm to obtain better estimates of the coefficients. The methods are applied in a real case, where the input parameters of the models are assigned based on the key issues involved in a spherical tank construction. The results reveal that while a high correlation between the estimated cost and the real cost exists; both ANNs could perform better than the hybridized regression models. In addition, the ANN with the Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm (LMNN) obtains a better estimation than the ANN with the Bayesian-regulated learning algorithm (BRNN). The correlation between real data and estimated values is over 90%, while the mean square error is achieved around 0.4. The proposed LMNN model can be effective to reduce uncertainty and complexity in the early stages of the construction project. © 2017, The Author(s)."

Cost estimating is one of the uses of BIM that has the potential to reduce considerably the time and cost required for estimating construction cost of a building project. In this use, type of materials along with their quantities and properties are extracted from building information models and mapped to a cost estimating database in order to estimate the cost. However, interoperability issues currently exist in the industry for the exchange of information from BIM authoring software to cost estimation tools impedes reaching to the full potential efficiency in this use. This paper identifies common information exchange workflows between BIM authoring and cost estimating tools and discusses their advantages and issues. It continues with studying potentials in leveraging open information modeling standards for addressing the identified shortcomings in the workflows. Next, a level of development (LOD)-based cost estimating framework is proposed that uses open information modeling standards for addressing inefficiencies in different detail levels of cost estimating approaches commonly being practiced in the industry. This framework facilitates automated digital information exchanges in the process of using BIM for cost estimating and promotes the implementation of BIM-based cost estimating from early stages of projects. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

EPC contractors involved in the bidding process face the task of submitting 'qualification free' techno-commercial proposals within a short time frame which provides challenges to the tenderer for a package having a level of design not mature enough for the estimation purpose. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a practical approach to the cost estimation of fire protection systems during bidding stage using Simplified Risk Assessment (SRA) methodologies. The methodology adopted was to conduct a risk assessment for a typical bid to arrive at the sound cost estimate for the fire protection systems. Typically fire protection requirements come in form of recommendations from safety/risk studies, hence cost attached to fire protection requirements were estimated based on the results from SRA for a typical bid. The Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) was performed using DNV-GL PHAST software to carry out consequence analysis to identify the extent of fire impacts. Subsequently, frequency analysis was conducted using parts count methodology to cumulate the frequency of fire scenarios. The most prominent leak scenarios for the study were considered as a part of the simplified approach in lieu of considering exhaustive scenario combinations based on different leak sizes, weather parameters, leak directions, etc., which traditionally forms part of detailed QRA. The selection of prominent leak scenarios was based on the good practice followed in the industry supported by the requirements specified within Operator Standards as well. The Fire Risk Assessment (FRA) results for different time intervals formed the basis for fire protection requirements. The study has helped to identify fire protection requirements for specific system/equipment/structure and further has helped in the submission of 'qualification free' techno-commercial proposals. The advantages of adopting this methodology based on SRA approach are deemed to be well-suited for bidding phase, where the time and cost of carrying out detailed risk analysis is not feasible. Application of such methodology would also provide benefits to the operators in receiving quick and reliable fire protection cost estimate. © 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers."

Its application from developing 3D models, structural analysis, cost estimation, and mechanical analysis has now expanded to other applications such as energy simulation. Multiple computer-aided design (CAD) tools work as BIM authoring tools to generate BIM files in different formats containing various types of building information. In addition, there are various building energy modeling (BEM) tools capable of importing these BIM files to perform energy simulation. However, such tools have various capabilities and limitations and need to be investigated and categorized in order to facilitate choosing a proper tool for design professionals in different phases of project and purposes. In addition, interoperability and data exchange issues between BIM and BEM tools should be understood in order to find solutions such as developing proper corrective middleware tools to rectify them. This paper reviews the challenges, issues, and shortcomings in BIM-to-BEM interoperability process (BBIP) by proposing a detailed classification for these issues and studying the available solutions. The paper also explains how a corrective middleware, which is developed by the authors using Python, can be utilized to modify a gbXML file prior to adoption in energy simulation to resolve the issues related to building envelope in BBIP. To do so, initially a review is presented on research studies focused on different types of BIM schemas such as IFC and gbXML and energy simulation tools capable of reading these files such as Green Building Studio (GBS), DesignBuilder, Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES), and OpenStudio. In addition, some of the challenges in the application of BIM for energy simulation such as interoperability issues, lack of standards, and lack of easy solutions for extending existing BIM schemas and available corresponding solutions are also reviewed. With the focus on building envelope in mind, three case studies are discussed to observe the challenges and issues with respect to BBIP using Revit, GBS, and OpenStudio. Moreover, these case studies provide an opportunity to investigate the application of corrective middleware tools similar to what is developed in the study presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

At the core of the model is a specialized absorbing Markov chain, which stochastically models the construction product fabrication process while considering quality-induced rework uncertainty. The model parameters are dynamically updated using real-time quality management and cost management information to achieve more accurate and reliable simulation outputs. Furthermore, two types of decision-support metrics are developed to support rework cost management processes, namely (1) rework cost estimation during the project planning phase, and (2) rework cost control during the project execution phase. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the functionalities of the model and the implementation of the decision-support metrics.

The frame connections are then automatically detailed to produce a bill of quantities suitable for fabrication. Next, the total installed cost is estimated based on unit rates maintained by suppliers on a secure web portal.

This study investigated the main causes of delay in privately funded large building projects in Bangladesh. To determine the causes of delay, a structured interview with 70 respondents was conducted with project owners, consultants, and contractors. Using the importance index analysis method, the study identified the critical causes of delays. The ten most important causes are: (1) lack of experienced construction managers; (2) lowest bidder selection; (3) owners’ fund shortage; (4) lack of proper management by the owners; (5) improper planning and scheduling; (6) lack of skilled workers; (7) inaccurate time and cost estimation by the contractors; (8) site constraints; (9) improper progress monitoring and cost control; and (10) contractors’ cash flow problem during construction. Furthermore, Kruskal–Wallis test indicates that there is no significant variation among the three groups of respondents, i.e., owners, consultants, and contractors. The finding of this study is significant for identifying the most important causes of delay in large building projects.

The main aim of GR is to replicate 'natural' landforms for the new conditions after mining and to restore functionality and diversity of ecosystems at degraded sites. The correct application of the GR technique ensures visual integration with surrounding landscapes. Although GR is a broad term, referring to any geomorphic restoration of land, GR is often synonymous with fluvial GR, mostly following the GeoFluvTM-Natural Regrade method. This paper describes how and why the application of GR through GeoFluv-Natural Regrade in Spain since 2009 has attracted formal recognition by the European Commission (EC) of the European Union (EU) as one, among others, of a catalogue of best available techniques (BATs) for the management of waste from extractive industries, in accordance with the European Directive 2006/21/EC. GR has been recognised as BAT at the EU for multiple reasons, including mine site monitoring results that demonstrate increased physical stability with minimised erosion from stormwater and snowmelt runoff; natural hydrological function being established; the variability within the formed landform promotes ecological diversity for vegetation and wildlife communities; construction and short and long-term maintenance and repair costs are minimised; and visual impact of the mined landscape is reduced. This paper describes also the role of GeoFluv-Natural Regrade GR in the L'Instrument Financier pour l'Environnement (LIFE) program, which is the EU's most important funding instrument addressing environment and climate action. A focus is provided on the LIFE TECMINE project, described in detail, since it is the most recent and complete GeoFluv-Natural Regrade example in Europe. The TECMINE project is a geomorphic-based ecological restoration project in the Valencia province, within the Iberian Mountain Range and where conventional mine rehabilitation practice, based on gradient terraces, shows general and widespread failure. The demonstration project is fostered by the Administration of the Valencia Region, which seeks to test innovative techniques (GR, micro-catchments, soil amendments and new protocols of revegetation) for mine rehabilitation, promote improved practices and disseminate the best practice output through their development and analysis. Testing GR is the main focus of the project. The application of GR at the TECMINE project included (a) finding 'natural' and 'stable' landforms and landscapes to be used as reference or analogues for replication in GR, although difficult, was possible due to ancestral land transformation; (b) the steep terrain, characteristic of the Iberian Range, challenged the formation of GR GeoFluv-Natural Regrade designs, but the project demonstrated that they can be implemented in that mountain setting; (b) the mining company reported similar cost estimations for this alternative GR rehabilitation (as-built) as that for a conventional restoration design (projected); (c) a holistic approach to GR, not dealing only with topography, allowed the identification and use of limestone colluvium as an adequate growth media for initiating soil development; this solution not used before for rehabilitation in this region provided a clear and advanced contribution from the project. © 2019 Australian Centre for Geomechanics.All right reserved."

The completed cost estimation model were validated through inter-rater agreement between Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the field and verified by comparing the estimated cost calculated by the model and the actual bidding cost.

The developed model computes the cost impact of delayed milestone in the expected budget. Using a risk integration approach revealed the critical time frame that may lead to a budget deficit for a project. As a result, a number of cost-sensitive risk factors and schedule delays were identified for the critical time period where the risk of budget deficit increases. The method of integration proposed in this article highlights the priority of risk factors and schedule delays for construction contracts involving Payments at Event Occurrences (PEO). Consequently, the developed method can be useful for practitioners in anticipation of potential increase of costs, hence, prevention of failure due to budget deficit. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis."

As BIM is trending in construction industry, and many countries make decisions to require BIM in public contracts, the demand for various utilization of digitized construction related data increases. One of utilization options is the use of BIM for quantification of construction projects production and for following cost estimation. The paper presents results of a research on possible methodologies for such BIM utilization. The methodology has not been established yet, as there are many various estimation systems with different requirements - e.g., cost estimation systems require a different structure, information models have different standards, country specific legislation requires different information, calculation formulas vary etc. The paper shows and explains different solutions for different cases in general, so the results are applicable for most of the different cost estimation systems throughout the world. The presented solutions are then compared to show their advantages and disadvantages for the purpose of possible implementation of new systems. Based on general methodologies, country or company specific steps may be taken to properly develop the working system for BIM data utilization in cost estimation processes.

The focus of this digitalization is on building information modeling (BIM). Due to the growing usage of BIM, the requirements on the models are increasing, professional costumers, especially, require visualizations, cost estimation and scheduling, as well as an implementation of product data. Furthermore, costumers demand model checking, to see if a model fulfills the required guidelines, standards or product specifications. At this point in time, model checking is mostly manual and does not use the automation potentials of model checking with BIM. This paper focuses on the development of model content and validation checking. The aim is to define structures and methods to check models in the special case of professional project developers. Based on this, the development starts with an analysis of predefined building descriptions and Level of Development definitions. Afterward, an overview of the current state of the art and scientific knowledge in model checking is given. After that, the paper practices the content and validating checking based on an example model. The realization of the content checking is done by Solibri Model Checker and DesiteMD. The checking of the building description is difficult to realize because no current software solution can check all the requirements of a building description. Therefore, it was necessary to develop customized model-checking rules in DesiteMD. The functionality of the model-checking rules is proven by an example model. The advantages and disadvantages of the developed checking rules and methods are analyzed, as well as the database which provides the model checking content of the rules.

It helps reduce the effort in cost estimation to survey the cost feedback on alternative schemes in the early stages of design. However, at these stages, the quantity could be absent or in excess because the BIM model has a low level of development (LOD). The building elements that have layered structures such as architectural walls always face such problems. This is because during the construction phase, each layer may have a different dimension. For instance, the height of the interior finish layer of the wall may be shorter than that of the core layer. On the other hand, the walls in a BIM model during the early stages usually have low LOD. Each wall layer is not created separately and some walls may overlap structural elements because the designers need a schematic BIM model that is easy to create and manipulate. This research proposes a method that will improve the accuracy of the wall quantity takeoff in the schematic BIM model by applying the concept of BIM-based clash detection. The proposed method automatically detects the overlapped areas and subtracts or adds the material quantity of each wall layer without the need for editing the BIM model. The now accurate quantities can then be used in the chosen project delivery method where a cost estimation feedback is needed during the early stages of the design process. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

Because predicting CCI is crucial to the investment planning, bidding, and profitability of construction projects, considerable effort has been devoted to CCI estimation, and substantially accurate results have been obtained. However, these findings were based on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of data, which limits the estimation accuracy for fluctuating data. To overcome the limitation of such conventional methods, the present study aimed to refine CCI prediction performance by applying the concept of long memory. First, the existence of long memory in CCI is examined by performing rescaled range (range/scale or R/S) analysis. Second, a time-series model was developed: the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model, which reflects the characteristics of long memory. Finally, the prediction performance of the ARFIMA model was compared with that of the conventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. CCI data from January 1990 to August 2016 were used to develop these models. The results showed that ARFIMA outperformed ARIMA in terms of prediction performance, on average, by 9.5%. The ARFIMA model achieved higher CCI prediction performance by incorporating the properties of long memory. In summary, the results confirmed the importance of applying long memory to CCI predictions. Furthermore, the developed model could play a key role in improving the accuracy of cost estimation in the construction market. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The contractor should devote significant time and resources to accurate cost estimation of project orders from clients. However, it is impossible for any contractor to devote significant time and resources to all the orders because such resources are usually limited. For this reason, the contractor must dynamically decide bid or no-bid on the orders at each order arrival, and allocate the limited resources to the chosen orders. In this paper, we develop a simulation model of the project cost estimation process by reference to a generic model of dynamic scheduling for the state-dependent work. Then we devise a simulation-based method for dynamic scheduling in the project cost estimation process by using the model to maximize the contractor’s profits. The method dynamically selects orders and allocates the limited resources to them, on the basis of the contractor’s resource utilization, and the expected profit from the order. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulation experiments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."

To address these challenges, a Water pipe installation COnstruction CoST Estimation model (WaterCOSTE) has been developed to estimate the installed pricing for various pipe materials and diameters under a wide range of bury and embedment conditions. TheWaterCOSTE model uses a bottom-up pricing approach commonly used by contractors to estimate installed pricing for high-density polyethylene (HDPE), PVC, ductile iron, and steel water pipe. WaterCOSTE is used to estimate installed pricing for a potential large-scale real-world water transmission project in northeastern Arizona.

Therefore, the development concerned on mitigating such problems by applying the eco-efficiency modeling to use as a sustainable design guideline for the new project development. The term of eco-efficiency is defined as the ratio of improvement cost per unit of the environmental impacts. This study formulates the eco-efficiency model by using the change of construction cost of outdoor environmental and their impacts which refer to the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) as indicator for thermal comfort index of humans and stormwater runoff. The cost is calculated by simple cost estimation technique. Meanwhile, the microclimate model ENVI-met BioMet (V4) was used for predicting the effect different design options on outdoor thermal comfort using PET, and the Stormwater Runoff Test (SRT) is also calculated by the academic Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) for Autodesk Infraworks 360 software. The results present as the prediction function of the eco-efficiency of the outdoor environmental design. Research suggests that pervious paving materials are broadly capable of lowering temperatures and improving human thermal comfort, and when integrated with trees have potential to meet eco-efficiency objectives.

Structural analysis is an essential way to ensure structural safety. However, different structural analysis software may not process all information from building information models (BIMs) correctly, which impedes BIM interoperability. To address this problem, the authors proposed a new method for automatically checking information completeness of BIMs to support BIM usage in structural analysis in an interoperable manner. The method was tested in an experimental implementation using python programs and a structural analysis software. The checking results using the proposed method was compared with results from a manual checking and a model view definition (MVD)-based checking, respectively. The experiment showed a comparable or better performance of the proposed method in accuracy and efficiency than manual checking and MVD-based checking. Furthermore, the proposed method overcomes the scope limitation possessed by MVD-based checking.

BIM has been widely utilized for solving the drawbacks of traditional preliminary cost estimation by creating a cost-estimation model. However, since the function of structural analysis and design in BIM is still in its developing stage, the model still lacks precise information of the structural engineering. As a result, the model hypothesizes the structural engineering quantity on the basis of the empirical formula, contributing to a slight inaccuracy in its approximation. Hence, to overcome these shortcomings, this research presents a conceptual cost-estimation model created by linking ETABS (a software used for structural analysis and design of buildings) to the BIM-based model. With the integration of the ETABS and the BIM model, the proposed model can simultaneously consider the two factors (the budget, and the structural analysis) for cost estimation in the early stages of the project: (1) establishing a BIM model on Revit, (2) applying ETABS to conduct structural analysis and design on the BIM model, (3) obtaining quantity takeoffs of the BIM model by Navisworks, (4) retrieving unit price data from PCCES software through results of the quantity takeoffs, and (5) ratifying whether the projected cost meets the owner’s budget. The proposed model is tested via a building located on a certain university campus in northern Taiwan. The results show that the proposed conceptual model is significantly superior to the original BIM-based model, and demonstrate that the proposed model can be practically implemented and provide adequate results for the projected cost. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

This indicator shows that a measure must be implemented if its cost (i.e. Capital Expenditure), is not grossly disproportionate if compared to benefits–represented by casualties suppression-reached by the measure. Due to this, a risk reduction measure is reasonable feasible unless its cost is highly disproportionate in comparison to its benefits. In hydrocarbon transportation industry, benefits represent the avoided cost if threats take place; on the other hand, for risk mitigation cost estimation, the cost per casualty averted must be accounted. The latter, provides a global cost of the mitigation measure adopted in relation to the direct cost of construction, with the reduction of the level of risk (i.e. social risk) and with the expected design period for that measure. In this last concept, the higher the reduction in the level of risk or the longer the design period of the mitigation measure, the lower the cost per casualty averted, a fact that reflects an effective mitigation measure in terms of risk reduction and its durability.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical factors that affect accuracy of cost estimation and evaluate the degree to which these factors are important from contractors' and consultants' viewpoints. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were adopted in collecting and analyzing the data, and testing the hypotheses. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire was prepared and then was modified according to the results of face-to-face open-ended interviews conducted with 11 project managers. The final version of the questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 265 respondents. For analyzing the collected data Kendall's and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted. Findings - The analysis revealed that there is a strong agreement between contractors and consultants in the ranking of the factors related to consultant, contractor, design parameters, and information. A slightly weak agreement between contractors and consultants was noted regarding the factors related to market conditions (external factors) and factors related to project characteristics. Furthermore, the results show that the top ten factors affecting the accuracy of cost estimate are clear and detail drawings and specification, pricing experience of construction projects, perception of estimation importance, equipment (cost/availability/ performance), project complexity, clear scope definition, accuracy and reliability of cost information, site constraints (access, storage, services), material availability, financial capabilities of the client, and availability of database of bids on similar project (historical data).

However, there are several types of delays that significantly influence project durations, often resulting from misunderstanding and miscommunications among parties (owners, contractors, and other stakeholders). One of the more common delays is change orders that are usually attributed as one of the major reasons behind delays in construction. Making changes after a building enters the construction phase can be very expensive, conflicting, and time-consuming. Such delays may arise due to the lack of communication and coordination among the owner and the contractors regarding the change orders. In most instances, it is highly conflicting to form a mutual agreement when there is a predicted price difference to accept a change order. To minimize the impact of change orders on the design and total cost, an approach that allows communication and interaction with 3D models through advanced visualization tools (i.e., virtual and augmented reality environments) can be effective. To further identify the influence of immersive virtual environments (IVEs) on project management, a systematic approach is proposed through which stakeholders can: (1) visualize and interact with 3D models in one-to-one scaled realistic virtual environments (fully immersive); and (2) visualize the dollar amount changes as the results of change orders. The results of the presented case study show that clients can exercise the ability to make changes virtually well before actual construction begins. © ASCE."

The process of making cement is divided into two groups, namely hydraulic cement and non-hydraulic cement. Hydraulic cement consists of Portland type cement and PCC type cement, PPC cement and slag cement. The type of PCC cement (Portland Composite Cement) is produced from grinding clinker with gypsum with the addition of third raw material. The purpose of this research is to know the effect of cement quality improvement with substitution of basalt scoria stone raw material as much as 0-10% as the third raw material. The source of basalt scoria stone originated from Lampung Timur, Indonesia. The fineness test showed ceme nt fineness was 2983-3665 cm2 /gr with minimum SNI standard 2800 c2 /gr. Residue test meets the requirements of SNI standard that is equal to 16,07% -18,55%. The compressive strength test was performed at ages 3, 7 and 28 days and obtained the result that the optimum compressive strength produced was 235, 314, 394 kg/c2 .

The main reason is that the current cost estimation methods, which are linear with low accuracy, can not reflect the uncertainty and nonlinear relationship between the cost and influence factors. The artificial life algorithm has high full range of search ability, based on which, more precise global optimal values can be obtained through iteration. Its characteristics of uncertainty, nonlinearity, self-organization, self-study, and evolution can effectively fit the complex systems of investment estimation. Combined with the whole life significant cost theory and the theory of artificial life algorithm, the WLCS-ALA model was set up, where the artificial life algorithm was applied to the investment cost prediction problem, and whole life significant cost model (WLCS)was used to simplify data processing. Through the calculation of the historical data of the significant cost of completed projects similar to the proposed project, the data sequence of significant cost items(CSIs), and significant factors(CSF)was established. Artificial life algorithm (ALA) was used to optimize the cost.

Cost overruns in highway projects have plagued public agencies globally. Hence, this research aims to develop a parametric cost estimation model for SHAs to forecast the completed project cost prior to project execution to take necessary measures to prevent cost escalation. Ordinary least-square (OLS) regression has been a commonly used parametric estimation method in the literature. However, OLS regression has certain limitations. It, for instance, requires strict statistical assumptions. This paper proposes an alternative approach - least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) - that has proved in other fields of research to be significantly better than the OLS method in many respects, including automatic feature selection, the ability to handle highly correlated data, ease of interpretability, and numerical stability of the model predictions. Another contribution to the body of knowledge is that this study simultaneously explores project-related variables with some economic factors that have not been used in previous research, but economic conditions are widely considered to be influential on highway construction costs. The data were separated into two groups: one for training the model and the other for validation purposes. Using the same data set, both LASSO and OLS were used to build models, and then their performance was evaluated based on the mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square error. The results showed that the LASSO regression model outperformed the OLS regression model based on the criteria. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Factors relating to client characteristics, consultant and design parameters, contractor attributes, project characteristics, contract procedures and procurement methods, and external market conditions [1] are examined for their influences on those four MCEI separately. However, very little attention is paid on the comparison of factors rankings across those four MCEI. Results from comparing those factors rankings improve the understandings on cost estimating issues. Thus, this study aims to compare the factors rankings across the four MCEI and evaluate the degree of agreement between the four sets of ranks for their influential factors. Four previous studies, each examining factors affecting each of the four MCEI are selected through literature survey for analysis. Influential factors from each previous study are assigned to their related categories: client, consultant, contractor, project, contract, and environment. Kendall's coefficient of concordance is used to assess interjudge reliability. The computed correlation indicates a moderate degree of association between the four sets of ranks. It is found that the four MCEI are influenced by different factors with different ranks and hence should be treated as different MCEI and be managed differently. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2016."

However, it's known that the costs obtained through this method in which only construction area is taken into consideration have significant differences from actual costs. The aim of this study is to compare the cost estimations obtained through “multi layer perceptron” (MLP) and “radial basis function” (RBF), which are commonly used artificial neural network (ANN) methods. The results of MLP and RBF were also compared with the results of UACM and the validity of UACM was interpreted. Dataobtained from 232 public construction projects, which completed between 2003 and 2011 in different regions of Turkey, were reviewed. Consequently, estimated costs obtained from RBF were found to be higher than the actual costs with a 0.28% variance, while the estimated costs obtained from MLP were higher than actual values with a 1.11% variance. The approximate costs obtained from UACM are higher than actual costs with a 28.73% variance.

A reliability test, correlation analyses, and regression modeling were applied to analyze the data collected from 101 construction estimation participants. The results indicate the impact of stress on both commitment and performance: (1) objective stress influences career commitment via an inverted U-shaped relationship; (2) subjective stress is linearly related to both career and continuance commitment; and (3) subjective stress also directly influences ineffective working processes through a U-shaped relationship. Other results show a separate and direct impact of the three types of commitment on different kinds of estimation performance: (1) affective commitment reduces ineffective working process; (2) continuance commitment exerts positive impact on organizational nonbelongingness; and (3) career commitment improves estimation accuracy.

To solve these problems, a building construction cost estimation model based on ontology representation and reasoning is established, which includes three major components, i.e., concept model ontology, work item ontology, and construction condition ontology. Using this model, the cost estimation information is modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules that leverage the semantically rich ontology representation to reason about cost estimation. Based on OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the cost estimation information can be translated into a set of concept models, work items, and construction conditions associated with the specific construction conditions.

There is a need for assessing the cost of these lines based on scientific principles as compared to those adopted conventionally based on availability of standard designs and line designer's experience. In the present study, an attempt has been made to develop a model for cost assessment and optimization of overhead power transmission lines using genetic algorithms. The results obtained from genetic algorithm optimization technique have been compared with that of interior point method based classical optimization technique. Correlations based on regression analysis were developed for cost influencing parameters of the transmission line in terms of the line design variables and are used in constructing the mathematical model for cost optimization. The developed model is capable of optimizing the cost while simultaneously selecting the optimum design variables influencing the cost of the line.

The available cost estimation models for these projects focus on the construction phase, with little or no consideration given to engineering services. This paper presents an artificial neural network model for the conceptual cost estimation of engineering services for public construction projects that considers both design costs and construction supervision costs. In developing the model, the authors first identify the factors that influence the cost of engineering services, and then apply a suitable artificial neural network for a cost estimation model. The model predicts the cost of engineering services as a percentage of construction cost based on project type, engineering services category, project location, and project scope. The model is trained on a data set obtained from the Governmental Tenders Department in Jordan, and then tested on some core data samples that had not been seen by the network during training. The optimal network for the model was selected by conducting a systematic search among a large number of networks with different network architectures and parameter values. The findings demonstrate that the model is able to predict the cost of engineering services with an acceptable performance for conceptual cost estimation models.

Emerging Building Information Modelling (BIM) can exploit standard measurement methods to automate cost estimation process and improve inaccuracies. Structuring standard measurement methods in an ontologically and machine readable format for a BIM software can greatly facilitate the process of improving inaccuracies in cost estimation. This study explores the development of an ontology based on New Rules of Measurement (NRM) for cost estimation during the tendering stages. The methodology adopted is methontology, one of the most widely used ontology engineering methodologies. To ensure the ontology is fit for purpose, cost estimation experts are employed to check the semantics, descriptive logic-based reasoners are used to syntactically check the ontology and a leading 4D BIM modelling software is used on a case study building to test/validate the proposed ontology. © 2017 Karabuk University"

The proposed approach is basically constructed on the basis of cost estimation process in the earned value management (EVM) technique. However, it attempts to resolve the present shortcomings in EVM estimation process and take into the consideration the cost-related issues so-called financial issues such as delay in client payment, and the time value of money. Furthermore, in order to cope with the uncertain conditions of real situations, the presented model takes the advantage of fuzzy sets theory which is a well-known method in dealing with the situations where the uncertainty arises. The proposed approach not only extends the theoretical framework of EVM but also gives a real insight into the project future performance. Finally, ten illustrative cases related to construction projects are provided to compare the obtained results of proposed model with the results of the EVM estimation process and to demonstrate how the model can beimplemented in real projects.

A questionnaire survey was employed in this study and 270 professionals in the construction industry have responded to the questionnaire; data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. The study findings indicated that BIM functions are significantly needed and important for professionals in the construction industry in Gaza Strip. Findings of this study revealed three components of BIM functions: data management and utilization in planning, operation and maintenance, visualized design and analysis, and construction and operation. Energy optimization was found as the highest important function of BIM of the first component as there is a high demand for sustainable building and sustainable development. A functional simulation in order to choose the best solution for lighting and energy was the highest important function of the second component. This function will assist in identifying methods to reduce resources consumption and increase on-site renewable opportunities. Model-based cost estimation was found the highest important function in the third component. Professionals in the construction industry will benefit from the findings presented in this paper by understanding the BIM functions which will encourage them to apply BIM tools that will lead to a substantial improvement in the performance of construction projects."

Previous works adopted a conventional approach in which a restricted set of macro project determinants, which are available in the preplanning phase, was employed towards direct estimation of construction costs. Aiming to reduce the prediction error in conceptual estimates, the current study adopts a novel approach from the domain of forecasting. This multistep ahead (MSA) approach relies on the idea of using several cascaded estimations to predict future values. Accordingly, building element quantities were estimated as the first step. In the second step, estimated quantities were combined with the existing set of inputs to achieve a higher accuracy in construction cost prediction. In order to test the hypotheses of interest, 657 building projects from Germany were analyzed using linear regression and artificial neural network methods. Conclusive evidence suggests that the MSA approach significantly outperforms the prediction accuracy of the conventional practice. To the best of authors' investigation, the current study is the first to offer such a cascaded estimation approach. Therefore, further empirical evidence is necessary prior to generalizing applicability of the MSA approach in construction cost estimation. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

It also reduces the effectiveness of planning and decision making not only for the contractor but for all parties involved. The problem keeps occurring despite many attempts made over the years to improve cost estimation and forecasting methods. This paper focuses on analyzing cost overruns in Turkey and comparing the cost estimates produced using the traditional estimating method against cost forecasts produced using the reference class forecasting (RCF) method. RCF is used to predict the final cost of a project predicated on actual cost outcomes of accomplished similar projects in the same reference class. RCF has been so far used to address estimation bias in early project development before design is completed and before all risks are accounted for to help a client to produce a more realistic forecast of the final project cost. In this paper, however, it is used to produce a forecast of the final project cost based on the contract sum. The work described in the paper involves collection of contract sum and final project cost data from 420 completed building projects. In order to test the ability of RCF to produce realistic forecasts of projects' final costs, 75% of the data are used to produce the cost overruns distribution and to determine the required optimism bias uplift values for the building projects, while the other 25% of the data are used for testing the accuracy of the forecasts produced for the final costs of projects in the established reference class. The results have indicated that the required uplift values are in the range of 4 to 44%. For instance, if the acceptable chance of cost overrun is 50%, 65% of the test projects would have required only 4% uplift of the contract sum to produce accurate forecasts of the final costs. If, on the other hand, the acceptable chance of cost overrun is only 10%, 5% of the test projects needed to use a 44% uplift to enable more accurate final project cost forecasts for the contractor. Additionally, to check the accuracy of the test data results obtained through applicable optimism bias uplift values, three standard error measures - root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) - are used. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

This paper aims to estimate the building costs of individual cooperative housing with crowdfunding model. A reference cost model of commercial building is firstly constructed and estimated, according to which the costs of housing projects can be estimated and the sales price can also be decomposed into different parts. And then the reference cost of eight typical housing construction projects in major districts of Beijing in China, is calculated using the constructed model and compared with the corresponding sales prices. The results indicate that the proportion of total construction cost is 10–15 % of sales prices and building housing with crowdfunding model can save about 20–30 % of expense. And the spread of the individual cooperative hosing with crowdfunding model is expected to impose downwards pressure on housing price and help to solve the housing problems of medium-income and low-income families in major cities in China.

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) offer distinct technical and economic advantages compared with LRs. SMRs are in development for both current and future generations of nuclear technology. Generation IV nuclear technology includes alternate system arrangements: the gas-cooled fast reactor, very-high temperature reactor, sodium-cooled fast reactor, and supercritical water reactor. Generation IV reactor designs feature varying improvements and differences from current Generation III+ technology that could affect economic performance. This study explores the economic differences between Generation IV reactor designs through the development of a bottom-up economic analysis of small modular reactor designs.

Presently large amounts of fly ash are generated in thermal industries which are dumped as waste, have an adverse impact on environment and humans. This fly ash in the powdered form can be used in concrete to replace cement. The utilization of by-products as the partial replacement of cement has important economic, environmental and technical benefits such as the reduced amount of waste materials, cleaner environment, reduced energy requirement, durable service performance during service life and cost effective structures. The objective of the paper is to evaluate a building in terms of cost and durability, by doing partial replacing of cement with fly ash. Firstly, the intensive literature survey is conducted from which it is understood that 25% partial replacement of cement with fly ask is suitable for M30 concrete. The quantity and cost estimate of a G+5 residential building is carried out which uses concrete without fly ash. Then the quantity and cost estimate is done for the same building by using fly ash concrete (concrete in which 25% of cement is replaced by fly ash).

This research sought to investigate the reliance on, and the reliability of the engineer’s estimate in heavy civil cost estimate. The research objective was to characterize the engineer’s estimate and allow owners and contractors re-evaluate or affirm their reliance on the engineer’s estimate. A literature review was conducted to understand the reliance on the engineer’s estimate, and secondary data from Washington State Department of Transportation was used to investigate the reliability of the engineer’s estimate. The findings show the need for practitioners to re-evaluate their reliance on the engineer’s estimate. The empirical data showed that, within various contexts, the engineer’s estimate fell outside the expected accuracy range of the low bids or the cost to complete projects. The study recommends direct tracking of costs by project owners while projects are under construction, the use of a second estimate to improve the accuracy of their estimates, and use of the cost estimating practices found in highly reputable construction companies. © 2017 by the author(s)."

There has been a lot of support from the Korean government to boost CCS projects, so that they may become commercialized. To conduct a CCS project, economic and geological considerations, as well as technical feasibility, are required. An excessively high cost prohibits CCS projects from being commercialized, even with the proper geological condition and technical feasibility. Therefore, it is essential to conduct an appropriate economic estimation analysis alongside the geological investigation and the technique development. The aim of this study is to estimate the storage costs of CCS projects, which are typically composed of capture, transport, and storage. Since cost estimation analyses have rarely been carried out in Korea, we have estimated the construction cost of the CCS storage by adopting assumptions made in the previous studies.

A portfolio of curved steel I-girder bridges located in the Eastern United States is used for this study. As part of the restoration curve generation, joint RSM-MCS models are created and utilized to assess seismic vulnerabilities of the target bridge portfolio and estimate their damage ratios. Probabilistic damage factor models in conjunction with MCS to treat uncertainties in damage ratios, curved bridge characteristics, and volatile construction conditions are simulated with the joint RSM-MCS-based vulnerability functions. Relevant restoration cost curves are then generated based upon average construction cost data of the United States. Findings reveal that characteristics for the restoration curves vary relying on variability in damage ratios and vulnerabilities, emphasizing that an increase in the difference between lower and upper cost bounds occurs as the seismic intensity increases. This evidence highlights the significance of considering variability in both damage ratios and vulnerabilities for more reliable decision-making for seismic restoration on such bridge portfolios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Therefore, for the characteristics of urban rail transit, such as large project scale, long construction period, difficulty on construction cost control, it is very significant to study and establish a set of urban rail transit construction cost control measures for the healthy and sustainable development of urban rail transit. Research conclusions: Regarding to the current problems in the cost management of urban rail transit, the whole process cost control's principle and measures are proposed. (1) In the pre-planning and project approval stage, an appropriate construction scale and construction standards should be chosen by combing with the actual and planning situation of the city, to provide the basis for cost control. (2) In the engineering design stage, the owner should select a preferred design company, and introduce design and cost consulting system. At the same time, design company should strengthen the awareness of cost control and carry out cost-limit design. (3) In the construction bidding and construction stage, the owner should select a preferred construction contractor, and strengthen contract management and on-site management. (4) In the completion acceptance stage, the project managers should directly participate in the completion acceptance and the project final accounts, as well as do the project audit.

The capability of two machine-learning algorithms, k nearest neighbor (k-NN) and perfect random tree ensembles (PERT), are utilized to enhance CCI forecasting, especially in the mid- and long-term.

For naval ships, AT&L (2013) concluded that contract work content growth (not capability growth) dominates total cost growth statistically. In addition, costs-over-target are significant and reflect poor cost estimation or faulty framing assumptions. AT&L (2014) also concluded prices on fixed-price contracts are only ""fixed"" if the contractual work content remains fixed, but this is often not the case. We show that under-sizing the ship during concept design studies increases ship outfit density and adds complexities to the design. These early-stage design decisions on sizing the ship are a major contributor to unnecessary work content growth later in Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) that cannot be eliminated no matter how productive the shipbuilder. However, new ship design methods are being developed and integrated with legacy physicsbased design and analysis tools into a Rapid Ship Design Environment (RSDE) that will enable a more rational process for initially sizing ships. We also identify the need for early-stage design measures of complexity and ship costing tools that are more sensitive to these measures, and propose solutions that will aid decision-makers in reducing DD&C work content by making cost-effective design decisions in early-stage naval ship design."

Today, this problem is a serious obstacle to the implementation of this type of organization of development of industrial areas of the city. At the same time, none of the existing methods of investment project evaluation, including those implemented under public private partnerships, provides for a comprehensive evaluation of the social factor. Ignoring this kind of evaluation will result in capital risk, higher costs and increased time to complete projects. The authors propose to consider a methodology for evaluating the utilization efficiency of former industrial areas, which is based on principles of integral assessment which includes the social factor. The result of the author's methodology is that it: will, in view of the social factor, determine the amount of total investment as the sum of costs before entering contracts.

To establish a progress curve, the costs that are associated with each scheduling activity must be determined. However, the distributions of the quantities (costs) of cost items among various activities are time-consuming to obtain and error-prone, yielding an unreliable S-curve. This work proposes the use of three-dimensional building information model (BIM) objects to integrate schedule and cost by using the powerful BIM for data acquisition and storage. BIM objects are incorporated into a proposed four-step model to establish construction progress curves. The proposed model defines search criteria (cost item, object, floor, and zone) that precisely identify takeoff objects for extracting the quantities of cost items associated with each activity. The BIM uses keynote, assembly code, and family type catalog functions to provide pop-up menus for the efficient identification of cost items that are associated with each object to preventing errors in the manual typing of cost-item names. Finally, this work demonstrates that uploading the cost items and unit prices into cost estimation software in advance is critical to automating cost estimations in BIM. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user. © 2016"

The paper specifically shows the application of the methodology for the determination of the cost of an Assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment in Italy. The reason of this research comes from the fact that deterministic regime is inadequate to implement an accurate estimate of the cost of this particular treatment. In fact the durations of the different activities involved are unfixed and described by means of frequency distributions. Hence the need to determine in addition to the mean value of the cost, the interval within which it is intended to vary with a known confidence level. Consequently the cost obtained for each type of cycle investigated (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection), shows tolerance intervals around the mean value sufficiently restricted as to make the data obtained statistically robust and therefore usable also as reference for any benchmark with other Countries. It should be noted that under a methodological point of view the approach was rigorous.

This attracts policy and decision makers a lot. Especially, project cost is one of the most discussed factors. This paper's goal is to investigate different types of cost estimation methods used in transport projects, identify their attributes that make them unique to specific infrastructure, and finally study their applications on transport infrastructure. In addition, the research looked to see if there is trend change on using cost estimation methods over time and checked the applications of methods in each transport infrastructure. The study used a systematic literature review (date cube creation, data filtering using primary and secondary search clusters, content analysis, etc.) to include as many estimation methods as possible. To find the trend, the study carried out a quantitative data analysis to investigate the frequency of each method over time in different modes of transport infrastructure. As a result, the research identified about 12 cost estimation methods and discusses them with three major cost estimation attributes i.e. accuracy, usability/application and easiness to understand. The quantitative analysis showed that parametric, Artificial Neural Networks and unit cost methods are the most used methods across the transport infrastructure. In addition, road infrastructure projects received the highest diversity and frequency of the cost estimation methods. © 2017 The Authors."

Various approaches have been used over the years to estimate TBM performance in a given ground condition, many of them were successful and within an acceptable range, while some missing the actual machine performance by a notable margin. Experience shows that the best approach for TBM performance prediction is to use various models to examine the range of estimated machine penetration and advance rates and choose a rate that best represents the working conditions that is closest to the setting of the model used for the estimation. This allows the engineers to avoid surprises and to identify the parameters that could dominate machine performance in each case.

However, practitioners have expressed the need for cost normalization techniques to evaluate phase-level outcomes during ongoing projects. This paper aims to provide a cost normalization framework tailored to phase-based performance assessment. The framework involves three main steps: currency conversion, location adjustment, and time adjustment with considerations for various scenarios where the required information is not fully available.

It is the size of capital expenditures that determines the choice of one option or another in field facilities and transport infrastructure. As practice shows, key performance indicators for oil and gas development projects are most sensitive to the amount of capital costs. Giprovostokneft JSC has long-term experience in implementation of capital cost optimization system based on specific 'per unit' indicators used on the early stages of investment process. The article reviews the main principles for construction and appliance of 'per unit' indicators: monitoring of innovative technologies and changes of resource intensity in order to adjust the resource model, on which the ""per unit"" indicator is based; availability and constant updating of the objects database; monitoring of precision and reliability of cost estimation based on the ""per unit"" indicators and their resource models; correct specification of the model and competent selection of significant parameters for each object; decomposition principle; establishing and adjustment of objects' passports at different stages of investment cycle. The economic effect is demonstrated on specific examples of capital cost optimization in development of Central Khoreyverskoye Upheaval fields cluster. There are identified further ways of improvement of estimation precision and capital cost optimization in oil and gas projects: 1) permanent filling of 'per unit' database with extension of range of objects and classification attributes; 2) recognition of significant parameter set that helps to construct accurate cost models and provide wide opportunities for optimization."

Two alternative solutions for the pier cap on one of the bridge crossings over IH-35E in the IH-635 project were analyzed in this case study, a cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete cap and an innovative prefabricated steel–concrete composite cap. The approach was to use an estimation of direct costs for material and labor and consideration of construction time schedules. A supplementary numerical modeling confirmed that both alternatives behave elastically under imposed loads. The direct cost of material and labor for the two alternatives were close. However, the composite alternative required 13 days less construction time, resulting in substantial cost savings from traffic closing in the very busy traffic corridor.

This expert system is based on quick modeling of the building process by use of typical construction technology network diagrams, which can be prepared in advance. The typical network diagrams can be modified according to the spatial conditions of a certain building and to the amount of construction works and materials. For utility assessment a vector of 10 main aspects (criteria) was created with a common measure unit and certain level of importance each. A database of construction processes was created including the aspects for utility assessment. Thus, the model of the building process can be made about 50 times quicker than by current project management systems and it can be used for bidding, project planning and management and utility assessment. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017."

The survey respondents included project owners, contractors and consultants involved in Iranian Gas-Oil construction projects. The results of the survey revealed that the main causes of cost overrun in this industry include inaccurate cost estimations, improper planning, frequent design changes, inadequate labour/skill availability, inflation of costs of machinery, labour, raw material and transportation prices. The first three factors are the project consultants’ responsibility and the appointment of qualified consultants and personnel training are strongly recommended to alleviate cost overrun.

Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

This study aims to establish an effective approach to formalize such specifications by using ontology. First, two typical specifications for construction cost estimation are analyzed and relevant models are established. Then, an ontology-based representation of two specifications is established based on the models. Next, a prototype tool for facilitating the establishment, modification, and extension of the ontology-based representation for estimators is presented and the use cases of the tool are illustrated.

Implementation of BIM, however, requires comprehensive research and strategic planning. Industry-wide and organizational implementation guidelines and standards have been published around the world either to encourage organizations to adopt BIM or to present the minimum requirements to be followed where BIM implementation is a statutory obligation. In contrast, governments or organizations in several countries such as Turkey have not mandated BIM implementation and provide no guidance. Organizations in these countries which plan to adopt BIM processes are forced to develop their own implementation plans. The purpose of this study is to provide guidance in BIM implementation for construction companies in countries where BIM implementation has not been mandated particularly during the construction phase of the building projects. 23 BIM standards and guidelines covering the BIM execution process have been reviewed. Topics that need to be addressed by BIM implementation plans have been identified and categorized under four headings.

It lowers the average internal temperature of the house by approximately 1-2° when compared to the energy-saving material used in a normal building. Bioclimatic construction also creates natural ventilation, heat removal, and can reduce indoor temperature. It also comes with an easy-to-build design to facilitate construction and can save house energy consumption. Practical application: This research provides helpful information of solar chimney wall and roof for both the owners and developers in adopting an energy-efficient house for sustainable energy conservation.

Design/methodology/approach: A considerable quantity of relevant formwork labour productivity data associated with each building floor configuration was collected from projects sharing similar characteristics. The data were analysed to determine the statistical significance of the difference between the two labour productivity ""means"" of the sample sets representing both populations. Regression analyses were further carried out to assess the impact of floor area on labour efficiency. Findings: The results obtained show a statistically significant difference between the two means of formwork labour productivity achieved, where the efficiency of ""forming"" the beam-supported floor type is, on average, lower by 57 per cent than that of the beamless configuration. The outcomes further demonstrate a significant influence of building floor area on the productivity of the form-working operation. Practical implications: The findings can provide designers with feedback on how well their decisions consider the requirements of buildability principles, and the consequences thereto on labour productivity. The depicted pattern of results may, moreover, provide guidance to estimators and project managers for reasonable cost estimation, effective planning and efficient labour utilisation. Originality/value: The general guidelines available for buildability improvement lack the supporting quantitative evidence, and thus are often viewed with scepticism, especially amongst design practitioners. On the contrary, the quantitative outcomes reported in this study are based on rigorous methodology, hence can be used as a supporting reference to ""formalise"" the specific buildability knowledge of the activity explored. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited."

To improve the reliability of cost estimation results using CBR, a recurring issue in similarity measurement has been to accurately compute the distance among attributes and cases for the retrieval of the most similar singular or plural cases. However, these existing similarity measures have limitations in taking the covariance among attributes into consideration, and reflecting the effects of covariance in the computation of distances among attributes. To deal with this challenging issue, this research examines the weighted Mahalanobis distance based similarity measure applied to CBR cost estimation, and carries out comparative research on the existing distance measurement methods of CBR. To validate the suggested CBR cost model, simulation data test and case studies using 99 multi-family housing complexes are carried out.

As green building projects are inevitably plagued with risks, this study attempted to assess the risks in green building projects in Singapore. Categorizing a list of 28 risk factors into 11 groups, the study performed a questionnaire survey and received 31 responses from project managers in Singapore. A risk assessment model was developed using the fuzzy synthetic evaluation approach. Using the proposed model, the likelihood of occurrence, magnitude of impact and risk criticality of each risk factor, group and the overall risk were calculated. ""Inaccurate cost estimation"" was the top risk factor, and ""cost overrun risk"" was the most critical risk group. The overall risk criticality was high, implying risk management was still necessary for green construction in Singapore. The proposed risk assessment model is reliable and practical for professionals in the green building industry, and can be applied in risk assessment in other countries. As few studies focused on risks in green projects, this study expands the knowledge and literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The framework planning for construction on the other hand defines the minimum requirements for tunnel driving at the expected ground conditions. The specification of requirements is set for all driving works – for tunnel and cross-sections as well as for shafts and complex areas with caverns and therefore varies in expected ground conditions and in complexity of the structure.

The design of Heat Storage Units (HSU) is based on analysis of heat cascades calculated for heat process integration of selected streams with Pinch Table Algorithm (PTA). Determined surplus heat loads, the temperature difference of storage material and the physical characteristics of heat storage material were used for computation of construction characteristics and estimated cost for Heat Storage Units (HSU). Two different approaches were used, heat storage process depends on industrial process parameters related to Pinch technology as well as determination of optimal volume for heat storage design on total cost for investing in such units. The designed Heat Storage system related to Pinch technology gave different compared to the approach with minimization of total estimated costs. The final selections of Heat Storage Unit design was determined with satisfying of Pinch Technology rules. The previously analyzed case study for heat process integration of Baker‘s yeast and ethyl alcohol production plant were referent system for upgrading for Heat Storage system. The cost estimation of designed Heat Storage Units (on both proposed ways) was made, and it was compared with estimated prices for hot and cold utility that would be replaced with Heat Storage for the whole annual cycle.

Here, we explore a flexible method for estimating physical adaptation costs along the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Our goal is to identify uncertainties that can hinder cooperation and decision-making. We categorized shoreline data, estimated the height of exceedance for sea level rise scenarios, and developed a set of unit costs for raising current infrastructure to meet future water levels. Using these cost estimates, we explored critical strategic planning questions, including shoreline positions, design heights, and infrastructure types. For shoreline position, we found that while the shortest line is in fact the least costly, building the future shoreline at today's transition from saltwater to freshwater vegetation is similar in cost but allows for the added possibility of conserving saltwater wetlands. Regulations requiring a specific infrastructure design height above the water level had a large impact on physical construction costs, increasing them by as much as 200%. Finally, our results show that the costs of raising existing walls may represent 70% to 90% of the total regional costs, suggesting that a shift to earthen terraces and levees will reduce adaptation costs significantly. © 2017 by the authors."

They usually take off the quantities of material and related work items and assign appropriate unit costs. In this case, unit cost assignment is solely at the engineer’s professional discretion. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in the building construction industry. Tools can be used to automate material quantity, minimizing the time necessary for engineers to engage in the quantity measuring process. This function, however, does not provide any information on work items that are related to materials in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Thus, engineers still need to verify associated work items and assign unit costs. This research proposes an ontological inference of work item that enables an automated search of the most appropriate work items and their associated unit costs. This ontology contains semantic information for work items and work conditions, as well as a semantic reasoning rule that activates the ontology. A case study confirms that the proposed ontology and semantic reasoning rule can work in real-world situations. This paper contributes by eliminating subjective decision-making via search of appropriate work items for cost estimation and the use of BIM data extracted from IFCXML. The proposed ontological approach to building cost estimation will assist engineers in more readily using BIM data from IFCXML and will be helpful in automation of the whole estimation process. © 2015, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The purpose of this paper is to develop, test and validate ANN models for predicting the costs of electrical services components. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research is based on data mining of over 200 building projects in the office of a medium size electrical contractor. Of the over 200 projects examined, 71 usable data were found and used for the ANN modeling. Regression models were also explored using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences Statistics Software 21, for the purpose of comparison with the ANN models. Findings: The findings show that the cost forecasting models based on ANN algorithm are more viable alternative to regression models for predicting the costs of light wiring, power wiring and cable pathways. The ANN prediction errors achieved are 6.4, 4.5 and 4.5 per cent for the three models developed whereas the regression models were insignificant. They did not fit any of the known regression distributions. Practical implications: The validated ANN models were converted to a desktop application (user interface) package - ""Intelligent Estimator."" The application is important because it can be used by construction professionals to reliably and quickly forecast the costs of power wiring, light wiring and cable pathways using building variables that are readily available or measurable during design stage, i.e. fully enclosed covered area, unenclosed covered area, internal perimeter length and number of floors. Originality/value: Previous studies have concluded that the methods of estimating the budget for building structure and fabric work are inappropriate for use with mechanical and electrical services. Thus, this study is unique because it applied the ANN modeling technique, for the first time, to cost modeling of electrical services components for building using real world data. The analysis shows that ANN is a better alternative to regression models for predicting cost of services elements because the relationship between cost and the cost drivers are non-linear and distribution types are unknown. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

A specialized data set was used, which was generated under a World Bank study that included 200 road work contracts from 14 countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and signed between 2000 and 2010. Two techniques were used for model development: multiple regression analysis and artificial neural networks. Classification trees were used as an intermediate step to evaluate the correctness of the selected parameters. A total of 19 variables, divided into three groups (oil-price related, country-related, and project-related variables), were tested for their influence on unit cost of asphalt concrete (AC) and road rehabilitation and reconstruction (RRR) costs. The analysis results showed that the level of corruption and the economic environment in a country have a significant effect on both costs of AC and RRR. The resulting models could be particularly useful for the planning and optimization of work on road networks in ECA countries.

However, the extent to which quantity surveyors (QS) (also referred to as cost consultants or cost engineers) are now using BIM features is not clear. The research reported in this paper was aimed at understanding the BIM experience of QS firms and cost consultants in Australia as well as to understand the progress they have made towards the use of BIM features. Data collection was a web-based survey of 180 QS firms with 40 responses and two in-depth interviews. Findings from the study show that BIM features are not readily used by QS firms owing to uncertainties concerning the integrity of three-dimensional (3D) models issued by designers, incomplete information in models, lack of knowledge concerning new business processes to drive the use of BIM use, lack of demand by clients, cost of implementing BIM features within the existing practice and learning time required to adopt BIM features. It appears that most of the firms have experience in computer aided take-off with two-dimensional (2D) drawing in the project's front end tasks such as cost planning and bill of quantities. Most of them have little experience with automated extraction of quantities using 3D models. Only one experience the use of BIM features in contract administration duties. 3D computer-aided drawing (CAD) drawings are used only for visualization. In many BIM-based projects reported, cost consultants were not issued the 3D BIM developed by designers; instead, 2D drawings were issued to the QS for quantity take-off and cost estimation. In cases where automatic quantity extraction was performed using 3D models, there seems to be lack of clarity concerning the time savings achieved because the QS spent more time checking the accuracy of the 3D model prior to quantity extraction as well as sorting, and splitting take-off items. In the absence of trust in the integrity of 3D models, QS would prefer to use the manual on screen take-off using 2D drawings and 3D for visualization. Also, in the absence of industry-wide standard for classifying, and coding construction works, QS would have no incentive to switch to five-dimensional (5D) BIM estimating. Ways of increasing the use of BIM features by QS are highlighted. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Massively, articles, research documents and reports agree that there exists a tendency towards underestimating the costs and overestimating the demand for transport infrastructure projects. It is therefore claimed that ex-ante evaluations of transport-related projects are often based on inaccurate material, which ultimately can lead to severe socio-economic misperformance. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between the inaccuracies in demand and cost estimations and hence the evaluation of transport infrastructure projects. Currently, research within this area is scarce and scattered with no common agreement on how to embed and operationalise the huge amount of empirical data that exist within the frame of Optimism Bias. Therefore, a full version of the UNITE-DSS model, which contains an integrated approach to socio-economic analysis, risk-based simulation and database information, will be presented. The procedure is based upon quantitative risk analysis and Monte Carlo simulation and conventional cost-benefit analysis converting deterministic benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) into stochastic interval results. A new data collection (2009-2013) forms the empirical basis for any risk simulation embedded within the so-called UP database (UNITE project database), revealing the inaccuracy of both construction costs and demand forecasts. Accordingly, the UNITE-DSS approach is therefore tested and further explored on a number of fixed case examples to investigate the performance and robustness of the traditional CBA results. Ultimately, a conclusion and perspectives of the further work will be set out. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Penetration rate is a principal measure of TBM performance and is used to evaluate the feasibility of using the mechanized tunneling. This paper will review machine performance of a hard rock TBM in 12.24 km long tunnel between Maroshi and Ruparel College which is being constructed to improve the water supply system of Greater Mumbai, India. Analysis of field performance data has been used to evaluate the relationship between various lithological units and TBM operation. The results of statistical analysis of the initial 5.83 km long tunnel between Maroshi and Vakola indicate a strong relationships between geomechanical parameters and TBM performance parameters in this particular project.

For this reason, four disposal alternatives (KRS-1, A-KRS-1, A-KRS-21, and A-KRS-22) have been developed in order to carry out the direct disposal of the CANDU spent fuel. The objective of this study is to conduct cost efficiency analysis of the disposal alternatives in consideration of price volatility for the radioactive waste repository. To derive future price volatility, this study used the ARIMA model. As a result, A-KRS-1 is the most efficient in terms of price per bundle using 2015 price. As for the results using ARIMA model, except in the case of KRS-1, the cost per bundle of A-KRS-1, A-KRS-21, and A-KRS-22 is decreased. Cost estimation using ARIMA model shows little change or decreases in cost while cost estimation using inflation rates for 2020 resulted in approximately 7.2% increases compared to 2015 for all options.

Such an attempt is presented here for the specific challenge of cost prediction when undertaking seismic retrofitting of existing structures. Using multilinear regression analysis, 14 independent variables were analyzed to develop parametric models for predicting the retrofit net construction cost (RNCC). Half of these variables have never previously been studied in the literature. The required data for this study were collected from 158 earthquake-prone public schools in Iran, each having a framed structure. The backward elimination (BE) regression technique was used to identify any variables that made a statistically significant contribution to the RNCC. The suitability of the BE technique for this identification was examined and demonstrated using a number of model-selection criteria. Rather surprisingly, building age and compliance with the earliest practiced seismic design code were found to be insignificant predictors of the RNCC. As reflected by the BE technique, the significant predictors were building total plan area, number of stories, structural type, seismicity, soil type, weight, and plan irregularity. The causal analysis performed between the RNCC and these variables showed that the first two variables have the greatest influence on the determination of the RNCC. The primary contribution to the construction industry is the introduction of a simple double-log cost-area model for predicting seismic retrofit construction cost. The introduced model enables engineering consultants, managers, and policy makers to simply predict this cost at the early planning and budgeting stage of seismic retrofit projects. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

To consider the effect of these factors on productivity prediction, the research presented in this paper assists in developing a productivity model for HDD operations. Potential factors impacting productivity are identified and studied based upon the literature and HDD experts across North America and abroad. A neurofuzzy (NF) approach is employed to develop the HDD productivity prediction model operating in clay, rock, and sandy soils. The merits of this approach involve decreasing uncertainties in results, addressing nonlinear relationships, and dealing well with imprecise and linguistic data. The NF model is tested using actual project data, which showed robust results with average validity percentages of 94.7, 82.3, and 86.7% for clay, rock, and sandy soils, respectively. The model is also used to produce productivity curves (production rate versus influencing factors) for each soil type. An automated user-friendly productivity prediction tool (HDD-PP) is developed to predict HDD productivity based on the NF model.

The model aims to minimize the total costs for new facility construction, truck routing, transportation infrastructure expansion, and transportation delay. A genetic algorithm framework was developed that incorporates a continuous approximation model for truck routing cost estimation and a traffic assignment algorithm. The numerical results show that the integrated solution technique can solve the problem effectively. © 2016, National Research Council. All rights reserved."

Design/methodology/approach: A building simulation approach in conjunction with a hypothetical case study using BIM software (Autodesk Revit) was adopted to identify primary housing information data set and to examine how housing information data set is processed within a BIM system. Findings: Housing information data set such as physical dimensions, energy performance, associated costs, risk level, weather data and other relevant data should be prepared at the outset of a project to determine the most cost effective refurbishment solution. Furthermore, BIM can enable both clients and construction professionals to make informed decisions about diverse climate risk resistant options by providing reliable cost estimations of them at the early design stage. Research limitations/implications: Actual housing information for the BIM simulation is limited, and as a result, hypothetical housing information based on the UK Government data were used instead. Practical implications: This research will provide essential housing information data set to utilize BIM effectively and efficiently for refurbishing climate risk vulnerable housing. Originality/value: This research explores possibility to utilize BIM for climate risk mitigation in the housing sector, and reveals primary housing information data set for BIM to develop a climate resistant housing refurbishment solution. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

A correlation of working capacity of the main components of technological lines (motor rotor, high capacity transport, car dumps) is necessary for economic reasons on electricity consumption. To achieve experience in the process was chosen excavator SRS 1400 from South Jilt career in the CET Turceni. The question of coal excavated volume has a great importance in the mine pits. At the excavation is desired a density estimate for each machine production tracking, cost estimation and tracking product unit profitability of each band on various sections zones. Permanent display size excavated volume snapshots in the excavator's cabin permits to track tape loading, eliminating unproductive times and information management to determine profitability. Another important requirement is closing the loop of the machine drive system of an excavator for a uniform deposition of carbon on the strip, thus achieving automatic control of the loading belt. Such equipment is important for the system dispatching in surface mine pits. Through a system of three ultrasound transducers to determine the smart instant of coal excavated section which, coupled with the tape speed, integrated over time will determine the amount of excavated coal. The basis of the system developed is a device for determining the volume and quantity of coal excavated acting on the march and optimize the system speed excavator working order. The device is designed primarily following the careers of lignite production: rotor excavators, rubber conveyor belts and dump facilities. Newly developed system aims to achieve the following determines: the optimum energy excavation depending on the nature of excavated material - lignite, shale, clay, etc., economic times to use the excavator bucket teeth rotor, energy optical regime to rubber belt conveyors, eliminate damage to the plant by conveyor belt breakage detection or tread and eliminating time and energy losses by limiting reproductive idle, monitoring the amount of coal excavated, control power consumption.

In this paper, the potential of CFRP tension members used in a spoke-wheel cable roof is demonstrated by comparing a typical spoke-wheel steel cable roof with a corresponding roof structure with CFRP tension members. The structural influence of carbon fibers with different properties is investigated. Cost estimation shows that the structural properties of CFRP tension members may lead to a cost efficient alternative for spoke-wheel cable roofs despite of their higher material price.

To achieve this goal, periodic cost estimation is vitally important not only in the planning phase, but also in the execution phase. Due to high uncertainty in operational environment, point estimation of project cost is oftentimes not sufficient to assist the decision-making process. This study utilizes Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), machine learning based interval estimation (MLIE), and Differential Evolution (DE) to establish a novel model for predicting construction project cost. LS-SVM is a supervised learning technique used for regression analysis. MLIE is employed for inference of prediction intervals. Moreover, our model deploys DE in the cross validation process to search for the optimal values of tuning parameters.

Focus of this study is small and middle-scaled residential construction sites. Drawings, technical specifications, bill of quantities of 25 concrete residential buildings with total areas that vary between 230 and 118,200m2 in Istanbul were examined. Site visits and information gathering were performed from site engineers. This study aims to give an approach for safety cost estimation for the early stages of construction bidding phase using risk assessment activities and construction project scheduling by focusing on construction activities. Additionally, a cost analysis was performed and the results were compared and analyzed with a former project that focused on 30 concrete residential projects in Istanbul. Primavera P6 was utilized for scheduling, and risk assessment was conducted using the techniques applicable for construction projects (i.e., L matrix and Fine-Kinney). Finally, activity-based techniques were used for cost estimation. The results of this study reveal that the percentage of safety cost to the total construction cost is 1.92%.

The design and construction of these OTCs are described in detail, along with cost estimation for each component. Eight OTCs, each with 1.2 m2 of ground area (four with elevated [CO2] and four with ambient [CO2]) were fabricated and four control plots of the same dimension were established to assess the chamber effects on plant responses to CO2. The [CO2] in elevated-CO2 chambers fell 93% of the time within ±20% of the targeted 600 μmol mol–1 CO2, based on 10 min averages. The CO2 consumption in elevated-CO2 chambers averaged 3.0 kg CO2 m–2 d–1. To ensure that the environment within OTCs was similar to the surrounding field, growing conditions were determined in all chambers and control plots. Adequate light transmission was observed compared to control plots (93%) and the temperature increase was 0.7°C on average.

The use of traditional methods to estimate tunnel project costs has led to significant cost underestimation because of limited information/data to compare different alternatives. To address cost underestimation, 40 cost estimating factors were identified by conducting a systematic literature review. Seven electronic databases were searched and articles were screened based on pre-established criteria. Of the 788 articles retrieved, 39 articles published from 1988 to 2013 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The resulting data was analysed using descriptive and Anderson-Darling statistical methods. The results of the analysis showed that the top five factors contributing to cost underestimation were engineering and construction complexities, geological conditions, cost estimation, market conditions, and environmental requirements. The findings from the review showed the importance of incorporating the effect of each determined estimating factor by state/federal agencies or metropolitan planning organizations when preparing initial estimates to avoid cost underestimation and/or to reduce the errors associated with such estimates.

From the economic point of view, it is not sufficient to base a design on construction costs alone. Rather all costs incurred over the lifecycle should be taken into consideration using lifecycle cost estimation. The University of the Bundeswehr, Munich, and the Ruhr-University, Bochum, have cooperated to develop a lifecycle cost model for tunnels in form of a Modular-Process-Model. The concept of lifecycle cost estimation, which is already used as standard in many fields, forms the starting point and is adapted and further developed to suit the specifications of tunnels. In order to implement a structured and transparent procedure for the determination of lifecycle costs, a hierarchic and modular structuring of the overall construction works is first carried out. The modules mostly represent independent units, which are built up in a generally valid manner for comparability. Various processes and attributes are then assigned to the modules, independent of the relevant lifecycle phase. The chosen method of structuring enables modular recording and evaluation of the lifecycle costs. Alternatively, the evaluation can be related to a process or a lifecycle phase. The modular format and the external interfaces also permit an evaluation and optimisation of singular elements. A probability-based extension of the model is provided to consider uncertainties, using a Monte Carlo simulation.

In this study, we first prepared an inclusive landslide susceptibility map for our study area using a Bayesian model. We next designed 12 road network alternatives using PEGGER, an ArcView GIS extension. We extracted the values of these alternatives from the susceptibility map to evaluate their environmental feasibility. We also evaluated the alternatives from an economic perspective using a model for conducting cost estimates of the forest roads. Our results show that this approach is useful for identifying the alternative that meets environmental and economic goals. The policy implications of this study suggest that if the development of road networks in mountainous areas is an important forestry goal, mechanisms should be aimed primarily at controlling slope instability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The investigation of BIM-based cost estimation confirmed that IFC can provide construction project semantics but incapable of relating domain semantics and pragmatics. In order to overcome this gap, we adopt organizational semiotics to fully reveal semantic units of cost estimation from a process perspective. Pilot study confirms feasibility of this approach. Future research will be a case study to collect all the instances for semantic units. Then semantic consistency and pragmatic implementation should be realized by the applications.

PREON box allows combining standardized manufacturing with high flexibility to respond to customer’s needs. To make even the planning process more efficient, a software tool has been developed specifically for the design of this system. The software is based on a specification defining the entire load bearing structure (parameterized components, girder types, preferred sections, standardized joints, requirements/limitation given by Eurocode). After entering the system data, which is mainly the dimension of the hall and a few boundary conditions for the loads, the structure is generated automatically. As a result of the subsequent iterative calculation, a complete design note and the bill of material including cost estimation is received.

However, the boosting approach has yet to be used in regression problems within the construction domain, including cost estimations, but has been actively utilized in other domains. Therefore, a boosting regression tree (BRT) is applied to cost estimations at the early stage of a construction project to examine the applicability of the boosting approach to a regression problem within the construction domain. To evaluate the performance of the BRT model, its performance was compared with that of a neural network (NN) model, which has been proven to have a high performance in cost estimation domains. The BRT model has shown results similar to those of NN model using 234 actual cost datasets of a building construction project. In addition, the BRT model can provide additional information such as the importance plot and structure model, which can support estimators in comprehending the decision making process. Consequently, the boosting approach has potential applicability in preliminary cost estimations in a building construction project. © 2015 Yoonseok Shin."

These items of highway planning are often complex and time consuming. Designing and comparing different alignment alternatives is even more time consuming and tends to be very costly. When planning for a new highway alignment, the general practice is to identify multiple alignment options and determine the best option based on multiple factors. This research proposes to automatically generate multiple alignment alternatives and the cut and fill quantities, costs, and schedules associated with each alternative in comparing different highway alignment alternatives. Building information modeling (BIM) technology has been increasingly used in resolving the complexity of a project in the building industry. However, the development of highway data schema and model using an object-oriented three-dimensional (3D) visualization is still underway and has not been fully implemented yet. This research proposes an object-oriented data model in compliance with ISO 10303 for highway design and construction. With the newly proposed data structure in highway design and construction, the automation of cost estimating and duration scheduling was achieved in identifying and comparing an optimum solution for alternative modeling and data output whose values provided aid in the selection process of design comparison.

However, the limited information available in the early stage makes the cost estimation challenging. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) to estimate construction cost in the early stage. Based on the hypothesis that similar problems have similar solutions, CBR searches for the most similar cases (e.g., previous projects) for a given problem (e.g., a new project). However, because no previous project is exactly the same as a new project, the solutions applied to the past project may not work for the new project, especially when there are no sufficient cases stored in the case base. To overcome this limitation, some studies have highlighted the importance of revision algorithms to account for the deviation of the new project and the identified similar past projects. These studies, however, were limited in considering the deviation of numerical variables while the majority of variables available in the early stage is more categorical (e.g., structural system or underground condition) than numerical (e.g., gross floor area). Based on this recognition, this paper presents a revision method considering the deviation of categorical and numerical variables using regression analysis. Application to multihousing projects confirmed that the proposed CBR model can increase the accuracy of construction cost estimation. This paper is of relevance to researchers in terms of providing a theoretical basis to incorporate both numerical and categorical variables in revising the CBR model. This paper is also of value to practitioners with regard to providing an accurate cost estimation tool in the early stage of construction projects. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Existing design studies, conducted to estimate the total cost for geological disposal, have been limited to estimates of approximate construction total time schedules. There were no case studies which compared the detailed excavation cycle time used in design studies with the actual results from an excavation taking into account each excavation cycle operation and task. In this paper, analyses of actual cycle time recorded during the sinking of the Ventilation Shaft of the Mizunami Underground Research Laboratory and comparison with the planned cycle time developed in the design stage are intended for an evaluation of the baseline work plan and schedule and for optimization of the calculations for application to shaft construction in any future repository in Japan. Actual times to perform three operations, drill and blast, muck removal and concrete lining emplacement were much larger than expected and represent the largest portion of the total excavation cycle time and had the largest impact on the efficiency of the excavation cycles and schedules. Operating at increasingly greater depths and excavating harder, more competent rock combined to significantly affect the shaft sinking speed. The underlying reasons for increases in actual times for the excavation cycle operations compared to their design estimates fall into three categories: constraints on construction; to ensure safety; and maintenance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Globally, several studies in the literature have focused on identifying the causes of these overruns and used statistical methods to rank them according to their impacts. None of these studies have considered the interactions among these factors. This paper examines interpretive structural modelling (ISM) as a viable technique for modelling complex interactions among factors responsible for cost overruns in construction projects in the Sultanate of Oman. In particular, thirteen interrelated factors associated with cost overruns were identified, along with their contextual interrelationships. Application of ISM leads to organizing these factors in a hierarchical structure which effectively demonstrates their interactions in a simple way. Four factors were found to be at the root of cost overruns: instability of the US dollar, changes in governmental regulations, faulty cost estimation, and poor coordination among projects' parties. Taking appropriate actions to minimize the influence of these factors can ultimately lead to better control of future project costs. This study is of value to managers and decision makers because it provides a powerful yet very easy to apply approach for investigating the problem of cost overruns and other similar issues."

The comparison was based on whether ECI had been used both during the design phase of a project and in the cost estimation of the project. The results clearly showed that across the alliance program there was significant improvement in cost performance and cost accuracy of reconstruction projects that received early contractor input. © 2015 National Academy of Sciences.

If the contingency cost could be accurately estimated during the contract's procurement phase, the CO cost could be properly managed during the construction phase. Traditionally, contingency costs are allocated around 10% to 15% of the project cost without considering any of the historical CO costs. In this study, a tool was developed to estimate the contingency cost of a road maintenance contract by using a mathematical model. The tool forecasts the contingency costs for each of the road maintenance activities included in the contract by using an artificial neural network model based on the historical CO data.

To meet such a challenge, it is necessary to explore the latest construction technologies, and to create innovative building systems that have the potential to bring high-performance affordable housing within reach of new markets. Light (cold-formed)steel (CFS) framing systems have proven to be a worthy alternative to traditional systems. Recent advances inthe application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) into the Architecture-Engineering-Construction industries present an additional mean to further enhance the efficiency of CFS projects. This paper presents a BIM based integrated approach for project scheduling and cost estimating of cold formed steel residential buildings. The approach integrates the basic 3D BIM model with the construction management tools used for project scheduling and cost estimation to produce a 4D BIM and 5D BIM models that can be used to enhance the project efficiency in both the design and construction phases. The developed models facilitate communication among all project participants and support project management in effectively planning on-site construction activities.

This paper finds that when measuring the similarity between the new project and historical projects, traditional similarity measure methods fail to consider the nonlinearity and muticollinearity embedded in the problem, as well as differences across crafts. An innovative similarity measurement algorithm was therefore proposed to tackle the above issues with a carefully designed orthogonalization process and Sobol's total sensitivity analysis. The application of the proposed algorithm to the craft quantity takeoff of a power plant project was introduced, demonstrating a better result compared with traditional methods.

To demonstrate the practical benefits of BIM application, we focused on the quantity takeoff (QTO) of a building frame by BIM modeling because accurate cost management is now seen as a critical factor for project value. Design/methodology/approach-QTO is the systematic breakdown of a project into units of work in order to evaluate the cost and time needed to complete a project. We analyze the traditional manual-based approach and the BIM-based approach to find the most practical method, and then examine comparative data from actual case projects. Particularly, a direct comparison of the QTO of building frames between two approaches reveals the accuracy and availableness of the both approaches respectively. Findings-As a result, the BIM-based approach shows higher QTO accuracy (95%) than the manual-based approach (less than 89%). BIM also has other advantages such as allowing partial calculation, re-calculation, and design changes during production stage. Moreover, because design changes are calculated automatically by the BIM operation, drawing omissions and cost estimation errors can be reduced significantly. Originality/value-Thus, project value can be improved by the application of BIM for cases in which all the available cost management information is handled and reproduced by different project participants. © Research India Publications."

A complete and unbiased pattern of variability of initial conditions in a mine can only be obtained when mining has been finished. Eventually, the soundness and optimality of mine engineering, economical and environmental decisions can adequately be evaluated and validated only upon completion of all mining operations. This study reports the results of rock mass strength analysis in Yukspor Tunnel driven by Construction Management-30. The tunneling is carried out in rocks of varied strength and, thus, at different inputs of labor and non-human resources. The local urthite/ijolite zone is composed of mixed composition rocks (mediumgrained trachytoid ijolite/urthite with pockets of pegmatite, feldspathic ijolite/urthite, finely grained ijolite/urthite) and homogenous rocks. It is advised to consider the incompleteness of data on site conditions at mine planning stage and to perform the related calculations for three scenarios: lowcost, moderate/most probable and expensive. The data on the project implementation conditions are refined in the course of the implementation. The introduction of this system of accounting for scatter of rock-hardness ratio in cost estimation of necessary resources requires: • improvement of the current management system; • creation of a mobile lab for measurement and control of rock-hardness ratio; • prompt processing and delivery of measured values of rock-hardness ratio to the appropriate subdivisions in a mine; • timely notification of a customer on progress of work, with the obtained results supplied; • implementation of management and other functions toward uninterrupted mining and construction."

However, according to numerous research studies, bridge construction presents substantial budget overruns. Therefore, it is necessary early in the planning process for the decision makers to have reliable estimates of the final cost based on previously constructed projects. At the same time, the current European financial crisis reduces the available capital for investments and financial institutions are even less willing to finance transportation infrastructure. Consequently, it is even more necessary today to estimate the budget of high-cost construction projects -such as road bridges- with reasonable accuracy, in order for the state funds to be invested with lower risk and the projects to be designed with the highest possible efficiency. In this paper, a Bill-of-Quantities (BoQ) estimation tool for road bridges is developed in order to support the decisions made at the preliminary planning and design stages of highways. Specifically, a Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a hidden layer of 10 neurons is trained to predict the superstructure material quantities (concrete, pre-stressed steel and reinforcing steel) using the width of the deck, the adjusted length of span or cantilever and the type of the bridge as input variables. The training dataset includes actual data from 68 recently constructed concrete motorway bridges in Greece. According to the relevant metrics, the developed model captures very well the complex interrelations in the dataset and demonstrates strong generalisation capability. Furthermore, it outperforms the linear regression models developed for the same dataset. Therefore, the proposed cost estimation model stands as a useful and reliable tool for the construction industry as it enables planners to reach informed decisions for technical and economic planning of concrete bridge projects from their early implementation stages."

Important offshore storage sites could be served by pipelines or vessels. The discrimination between these options is a crucial scientific task for the assessment of the potential of CCS and the design of a CO2 transport infrastructure. In this research the analysis of vessel transport cost is refined by the optimization of vessel size in a fleet scheduling context. A cost model for a point-to-point CO2 transport by vessel that includes liquefaction, intermediate storage, loading, vessel/fleet construction and storage has been derived from a comprehensive literature survey and has been optimized for vessel capacity. The cost savings potential of the optimization can reach up to 40%. A reliable cost estimation should therefore carefully account for the dimensioning of the vessels. The optimized vessel transport option was then compared to pipeline transport connections to offshore storage sites. In a compact graphical presentation it is shown that vessel transport can be advantageous compared to pipeline transport for long distances and small volumes. The breakeven distance of vessel transport becomes up to 40% greater due to optimized vessel size. The cost models were then applied to find the cost effective transport mode for a connection of the West Mediterranean region1 The term “West Mediterranean” is used for the description of the region including Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

However, the financial crisis led many financial institutions worldwide to impose stricter credit limitations and seek to finance only high-profit investments. As a result, the financing of transport projects was made even more difficult. At the same time, accurate cost estimates at the preliminary stages of a project are essential to all the major project stakeholders, since they are necessary for the budget determination, allocation and monitoring, the comparison of alternative projects and technical solutions and finally, the selection of the projects to be implemented. However, the degree of accuracy required is very difficult to be achieved at the preliminary stages due to the limited extent of available information. This paper presents a preliminary predesign cost estimate model for culverts i.e. conduits for the passage of surface drainage water under the motorway. Although individual culverts present low construction cost when compared to bridges, tunnels or large retaining walls, their total number along a motorway is significant and thus, their total construction cost is also substantial. The proposed model utilizes a properly developed database derived from actual construction projects to produce accurate quantity estimates by means of the statistical technique of linear regression. Following the estimation of quantities, proper material unit prices are applied for quick and reliable cost estimates to be provided. The proposed model only requires limited input and thus, can be used in the early project stages, offering valuable contribution towards the accurate culverts' cost prediction in motorway projects. © 2015 The Authors.

The bidding process is the main determinant of whether a contractor is commissioned to complete a construction project. Therefore, contractors must rapidly and precisely estimate construction costs and the bid award amount. This study involved optimizing artificial intelligence models to forecast bid award amounts for bridge construction projects. A genetic algorithm is used in several forecasting models, including models based on multiple regression analysis, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and case-based reasoning (CBR). Data for public bridge construction projects were collected from the Taiwan government e-procurement system. The cross-validation results show that the mathematical model for the ANNs provides more reliable simulations and has a superior fit compared with the regression methods, CBR, and the conventional approach.

Yet, there are two key issues associated with analytical cost estimation; the need to make sure that practice standards are adhered to and the implementation of subjective recommendations. The degree of precise detail, and the intricacy of standards and expert insight is a hindrance to its computerisation, as a result of complicated software development schedules and increasing expenses. A rule based semantic method is utilised as a model and is demonstrated as a way to tackle these problems. The investigation of BIM-based cost estimation confirmed that industry foundation classes (IFC) can provide construction project semantics but incapable of relating domain semantics and pragmatics. Our model is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implantation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). Moreover, organizational semiotics is employed to uncover the semantic components of cost estimation from a procedural standpoint and suggest an improved knowledge based system. This report outlines the way in which the proposed approach has been verified, by employing a selection of codes created by the prototype of the data based model. The standards of practice which have been establish are then verified, in accordance with actual building information gained from IFC. The utilisation of this approach has significantly advanced the procedure of automating professional costing practice within a BIM context. These pleasing outcomes demonstrate that, by implementing this model, the reasoning ability can be used by the BIM context and the restrictions around the application of BIM will be reduced."

The paper identifies the cost drivers that are used in parametric cost estimation model for water treatment plants. Cost estimation at planning stage of projects is important for the success of the next stages in the projects. It is also very useful at the design stage of a project when information is incomplete and detailed designs are limited in such an early stage. Literature has been reviewed and interviews were conducted with experts and officials in water treatment plants to explore all variables that influence the construction cost of water treatment plants. A questionnaire survey was then conducted to assess the impact of the identified factors on construction costs of water treatment plants. Datasets that consist of 160 water treatment plant projects in Egypt were collected. Construction cost drivers have been nominated through two different procedures. The first technique is descriptive statistics ranking of variables by evaluating Mean Score and Relative Importance Index based on respondents' feedback in conducting questionnaire. The second technique utilizes exploratory factor analysis on the collected dataset. These cost drivers are used to construct two predictive models for estimating the construction cost of water treatment plants models using artificial neural networks. Analysis of results was performed to validate the models and demonstrate their effectiveness. The proposed methodology aids public authorities to perform comparative analysis and evaluate the different alternatives of water treatment plant projects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are threatening the safety and economic welfare of Floridians. Every year Florida spends millions of dollar to mitigate direct flood damages. Amongst the effective solutions to these flood damages is the control of urban drainage in school buildings and nearby grounds to conserve and preserve natural resources and to promote sustainable thinking. This paper discusses how public schools in Florida can benefit from sustainable techniques by applying the sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) to school designs. The article also illustrates how Florida can use school sites as double functions to provide an active educational environment and to manage storm water runoff at the same time. Construction costs estimation for sustainable techniques is calculated based on data available for the year 2011 and compared with the conventional construction methods for schools. The result indicates a high initial cost that can easily be offset by considering the cost of conventional drainage structure, conserved storm water, flooding impact, storm water sewage disposal, and other measures.

Developing evaluation criteria and methods that reliably measure sustainability is a prerequisite for selecting the best waste treatment scenario with energy recovery and identifying non-sustainable scenarios. In the previously published paper, as the first step in assessing the sustainability of waste treatment with energy recovery, an established algorithm for assessing sustainability was presented. This algorithm provides the calculation of economic indicators by using a mathematical model. In most cases, in sustainability assessment of a waste treatment scenario with energy recovery the used economic indicators are: investment costs, operating and maintenance costs, fuel costs, energy costs and revenues. Unfortunately, cost estimation is relatively crude in solid waste management, without enough available data. The published cost data are often fragmented or reflecting specific unique cases with limited information regarding costs breakdown, specific local conditions, operating practices, system performance, etc. Cost planning for waste management has been discussed in various forms (user charges, economic analysis and economies of scale). Some have focused primarily on quantitative approaches such as optimization techniques, statistical methods and cost-benefit analyses. In this paper the focus is on the development of a new mathematical model for calculating the economic indicators (investment costs, operating and maintenance costs and revenues) of waste treatment scenarios with energy recovery depending on the composition and quantity of waste. The model is based on the analysis of the structure of investment and operating costs for each waste treatment and supported by the data available in the field and in the literature. The model is applied to calculate the indicator for the waste management scenarios with energy recovery: incineration and anaerobic digestion, and further verified in the case study of the city of Niš. The obtained results for the city of Niš, concerning investment and operating costs, are at the lower limit value of costs in the EU due to lower land prices, the construction costs, salary levels, etc. The higher price of electricity generated by waste treatment, due to government subsidies, leads to the total revenues being higher than the EU average."

For steel fabrication companies as suppliers of steel structures, submitting competitive project bids requires substantial knowledge of the company's practices on the shop floor and extensive experience to interpret that into credible cost estimations. Being able to make reliable estimates would contribute to the company's competitiveness in the long run. In this study, the total quantity of worker-hours or man-hours required for each major subdivision of a project is considered as the variable of interest in estimating a steel fabrication project, mainly because of the labor-intensive nature of steel fabrication. In collaboration with a partner company, three years of project data, were collected by matching the company's building information modeling (BIM) system with their labor costing system resulting in over 3,000 records, each representing the quantity takeoff for 46 design features and the worker-hours expended in shop fabrication. Stepwise regression and error analysis are used to recognize the most crucial design features in estimating project worker-hours, allowing discovery of the minimized set of inputs for estimating worker-hours and characterization of the estimation uncertainties. This labor cost estimation benefits estimators and shop production planners in that they can configure labor resources to deploy, schedule shop floor production, and recognize estimates' associated errors, based on the company's historical data. This study is an example of using BIM data and providing tools for structural engineers to consider steel fabrication and possibly achieve more sustainable designs. © 2016 The Authors."

The efficiency of on-site construction practice is contingent upon the effectiveness of the specific model used to communicate information. Architects use CAD models to develop a project design, while construction engineers use management tools and spreadsheets to assist in project estimating control and integration. Today, the efficiency of this process is dependent upon the ability of project participants to interpret these discipline-specific models in order to form mental pictures of a proposed design and manually perform material take-offs and estimating. This process contributes to misinterpretation and subsequent estimating errors. Advanced computer tools can be used to prepare smart designs which integrate these models and coordinate the crossdisciplinary tools used for design and cost estimating. The research described in this paper is intended to support the industrialized (manufactured) construction process of residential buildings, coordinating cross-disciplinary knowledge through the utilization of building information modelling (BIM)-based 3D-paremateric modelling.

Whilst relatively numerous studies have been carried out on the subject of IBS and CBS methods, there has not been any exploiting building information modeling (BIM) as a useful tool to calculate quantities, time, and cost needed to construct building with each of the two aforementioned methods. The aim of this paper is to calculate cost of two similar buildings (one is constructed with IBS method and other one with CBS method) and compare them in terms of economy based on a chosen case study and same initial investment. To this end, the construction cost of buildings is calculated using BIM software, namely Revit Architecture and Navisworks Manage for modeling the chosen case study and estimating construction cost, respectively. The findings indicated that IBS was not economic in low investment of company; however, with investment on more than 100 units of IBS, this method was shown more economical compared to CBS method. In addition, the initial investment on IBS method could be returned when more than 200 units of IBS were implemented in the projects. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved."

Regular technical-economic analyses (TEA) of current and forecast activity with a special regard to the changing conditions and TEA of new undertakings referring to new products, services and investments are necessary to ensure effective management. Only simplified methods of specifying technical cost of producing some of the extracts and optimizing some of extract parameters can be found in the available literature, however, there is no complex presentation of a simple method of carrying out TEA. This paper presents the method of carrying out TEA, which is a basic method of the evaluation of economic efficiency regarding the production of a well-known or new extract, processing a well-known or new raw material in current of forecast conditions and in the existing of new plant, taking into account: • the level and technical structure of manufacturing the product and/or processing the raw material, • the specification of influence of particular parameters on the level and technical structure of the cost of manufacturing the product and processing the raw material. The result of TEA may be one of the major criteria to be used for the cost estimation of extraction process in the existing plant and for taking up a decision regarding the advisability of the construction of a new plant and its size. The other objective of TEA is to specify and take into account all the cost factors connected with extraction process, which prevents accidental mistakes and contributes to lower extraction costs. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the view of flexibility and extensibility, ontology is regarded as a promising technology for formalized representation of the standards for construction cost estimation (cost standards for short hereafter) in computer programs. In order to automate the processes of construction cost estimation for estimators. However, the manual establishment of ontology for construction cost estimation (cost ontology for short hereafter) is labor-intensive and time-consuming for software developers, not to mention that there are numbers of standards for different types of construction projects in different regions. In order to solve this problem, a semi-automatic approach based on the framework of cost ontology that authors established previously is proposed to establish the cost ontology by using ontology learning technology. Firstly, the data sources, i.e. the cost standards are analyzed and the corresponding relations between information in cost standards and the elements in the framework are summarized. Then based on the corresponding relations, the approach is designed, in which concepts, relations and rules are extracted by natural language processing and domain lexical analysis to fill the framework. The approach lays a foundation for the practical use of ontology for automating construction cost estimation. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

It is the weighted average price of four major construction components from twenty cities in the U.S., and it generally represents the level of cost for the construction industry. It has, therefore, been widely used for cost estimation, bid preparation, and investment planning. Cost estimators and investment planners, however, are not only interested in the CCI at present, but are also interested in forecasting and predicting the value of CCI in near future. Although CCI increases over the long term, it is subject to considerable short-term volatilities, which make it problematic for cost estimators to accurately bid for construction projects. The accurate prediction of the construction cost can result in more accurate bids and avoid underestimation or overestimation. This paper presents a method that utilizes economic variables to predict CCI by applying the modified K nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It first identifies several economic variables that are highly correlated to CCI and collects the data for the period from 1994 to 2013. Then it splits the data into two parts: the first 95% of the data as the training set and the last 5% of the data as the test set. Finally, prediction models are developed by the training sets and tested on the test set to measure the prediction performance. Experimental results show that the modified KNN algorithm yields very small prediction error under the given dataset. It is anticipated that the proposed method will be useful for predicting CCI and several other construction time series indices in the short term. © ASCE."

The goal of the research was to improve the formerly proposed regression model based on a single network - especially to minimize the number of occurrences of errors with a high value. Due to the results, in the described problem of conceptual cost estimation obtained, committees of networks proved to be better solution for the regression model than a single networks.

Arced labyrinth spillways are spillways folded in a specific pattern and arced to increase flow discharge efficiency. A geometric design optimization scheme for arced labyrinth weirs was employed to analyze the feasibility of the geometric design and provide cost effective infrastructure. The optimization scheme for arced labyrinth weir geometric design is proposed for use in a spillway performance-cost analysis. The spillway optimization method that was developed integrates hydraulic performance and cost estimation to find the most cost effective, hydraulically adequate alternatives for a particular set of site constraints. This paper analyzes a case study that utilizes the proposed optimization procedure and compares expected hydraulic conditions and specific site considerations for over 10,000 arced labyrinth weir geometric designs for a specific case. After applying the maximum design flood as a constraint, the construction cost of the spillway was calculated. The resulting analysis determined the 10 lowest cost arced labyrinth spillway designs that can sustain the expected hydraulic conditions. These final designs were then subjected to an economic and performance comparison to a full-scale linear labyrinth spillway to determine the feasibility of the designs. The arced labyrinth weir resulted in the highest value based on hydraulic performance and cost criteria when compared to a linear labyrinth weir. © ASCE."

It has been rather a daunting working task associated with great learning experiences. It was decided early on from the initiation of the mechanical engineering program at the McCoy School of Engineering at Midwestern State University that the senior design project within the senior design class is a testing and enriching experience for senior mechanical engineering students as well as the teaching faculty. The senior design course and labs are conducted as a research experience for undergraduate students and their assigned faculty. The proposed senior project spans over two semesters, fall and spring, where the students experience a full mechanical engineering related project from the inception phase, through the design and construction phases, and finishing with the testing and analysis phases. The inception phase stands essentially for the brainstorming phase where the students are required to come-up with a set of diverse solutions to their assigned project problem. The design and construction phases stand for choosing an optimal particular solution for their problem according to a set of defined criteria. Then, the students start the preliminary design phase with related cost estimation, and then finalize the design with a set of final drawings. After the design phase, the students start building a machine, an apparatus, a prototype or putting together the elements of a process. In this period they work intensely, with their faculty, the purchasing department, and mostly the department machinist, or the surrounding town machine shops. The testing and analysis phase stands for designing an experimental set-up, writing a testing procedure, and obtaining real time recorded data and proceeding with its analysis. In this technical paper, the authors talk about the requirements for a senior project known as the deliverables, the teaching tools used throughout the class work and labs, the students' partial and final PowerPoints presentations and weekly and final reports. The authors describe the students overall achievements, and the archiving of the projects. Additionally, the authors talk about the twists and turns encountered during a senior project, with students, other faculty, the machinist, the lab technician, the secretary, and suppliers, and other difficulties experienced in running a full project with real final products. Finally, the authors talk about the aftermath of a senior project, eventual publications related to the project, and what is the view point of the American Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) on these senior projects.

This study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and a simple economic component developed in order to estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of six agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) in reducing irrigation water abstractions in the water scarce Pinios catchment in central Greece. Deficit irrigation, precision agriculture, waste water reuse, conveyance efficiency improvement and their combinations were evaluated and their CE was calculated for each Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU) separately and for the entire catchment. The results at the HRU scale are presented comprehensively on a map, demonstrating the spatial differentiation of CE ratios across the catchment. Based on the analysis, a catchment management solution of affordable total cost would include waste water reuse in areas adjacent to treatment installations, deficit irrigation in the least water deficient areas as well as precision agriculture in the most deficient ones. Conveyance losses reduction through the construction of piped irrigation networks was necessary for considerably decreasing groundwater overexploitation. However, since conveyance loss reduction entails significant costs, the resulting CE is not favorable. The methodology presented aims to facilitate decision making for agricultural water management by enabling modelers to combine process-based hydrological models with rapid and reliable cost estimations and use cost effectiveness metrics to identify and prioritize suitable irrigation water management practices. However, existing SWAT limitations are also discussed and the need for improving the accuracy of the representation of such practices in the future is highlighted. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

The first part concerns data collection, for which we have chosen special journals as sources for the surveyed proposals. The second part concerns the analysis of the proposals. To analyse each proposal, the following four questions have been set. Which intelligent technique is used? How have data been collected? How are the results validated? And which construction cost estimation factors have been used? From the results of this survey, two main contributions have been produced. The first contribution is the defining of the research gap in this area, which has not been fully covered by previous proposals of construction cost estimation. The second contribution of this survey is the proposal and highlighting of future directions for forthcoming proposals, aimed ultimately at finding the optimal construction cost estimation. Moreover, we consider the second part of our methodology as one of our contributions in this paper.

Uncertainties have been taken into account by adding a contingency factor. This approach has the advantage of being simple, fast and easy to communicate. However, it does not give any idea about the variability of the estimate and the risks involved, which limits its application. Therefore, the aim of the work presented in this paper was to establish a well construction model based on statistical methods to allow probabilistic time and cost estimation. Firstly, a literature review on probabilistic methods in well planning was performed. Then a model to determine the total well construction time was set up. Offset data of 16 wells was gathered and analyzed to determine a probability function for the duration of each process. Morning reports were the main data source for this task but also rig sensor data was used. The model was fed with the gathered data and verified by comparison with real historic results. Trends observed in the offset data were implemented to model the performance mean and its variation over time. Then a multi-well model was established. Finally, the model was extended by adding costs. With the presented approach of well construction modeling, one can deliver risk assessment for geothermal wells to investors, insurance companies and decision makers. This will aid proper budgeting and the calculation of insurance premiums. Moreover, the modeled technical limit or best historic performance can be used as technical performance reference. Based on the results of the sensitivity anaylsis, the key driving forces can be identified. Therefore, optimization strategies can be steered into the right direction."

However, it is currently both time-consuming and prone to error because of the working complexity and comprehending deviation caused by the traditional two-dimensional representation of design. The advent of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology enables a potential solution to these problems through the support of open data exchange standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. This paper discusses the key issues for semi-automatic and specification-compliant TBP cost estimation based on the IFC data of the design model, taking TBP cost estimation for the architectural and structural engineering of the cast-in-place concrete structure projects as an example. A Chinese national mandatory specification for TBP cost estimation is introduced as a representative specification and is interpreted into a computer-processable format. An IFC-based construction product information model of TBP cost estimation is established. A general process map and the involved key algorithms for semi-automatic and specification-compliant TBP cost estimation based on the IFC data of the design model are formulated. The application of the process map and algorithms in developing a prototype BIM-based software application for TBP cost estimation and the results of applying the prototype in an actual building project in China are presented. This paper lays a sound foundation for developing BIM-based software applications for TBP cost estimation in China, and demonstrates a feasible approach to satisfying the similar requirements in different countries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The authors have developed construction and O&M cost models for different unit operations and processes involved in water treatment plants. These models are developed from historical cost data and can be used to develop preliminary cost estimates for major project components and to screen alternative process trains of a water treatment project during the planning phases of the project. The historical cost data were updated to April 2011 costs by using cost indexes from Engineering News Record (ENR) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in addition to April 2011 costs of energy and labor. This paper presents the use of a single cost index to further update construction and O&M costs. This approach has significant advantages over using multiple indexes (such as ENR and BLS indexes) for different cost components. Using the method presented in this paper, future cost updating by ENR construction and building cost indexes becomes simple and straightforward. Actual bid prices for one new water treatment plant construction and two water treatment plant expansion projects were obtained from reputed consulting firms and compared to estimated costs by using the cost models presented in this paper. Further validation is recommended by use of the equations and comparisons of the costs to the detailed estimates and actual bids.

Nevertheless, the underlying responsibilities of the key stakeholders (clients, consultants, and contractors) in managing this chronic problem in the Australian construction industry remain unclear. By performing an in-depth analysis of the roles and responsibilities of these key stakeholders, this research is intended to unfold the industrywide perception of cost performance being heavily reliant on the contractor's performance alone. Based on a thorough literature review and relevant industry inputs, 73 attributes associated with cost performance were identified for investigation. Based on the relative importance weighing technique on 48 selected attributes, planning and scheduling deficiencies have the highest impact on cost performance from clients, consultants, and contractors' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analysis on the combined responses across all three groups suggests that robust control procedures and adequate programming, along with efficient design and effective site management, are the most critical factors. These factors are primarily associated with the responsibilities of contractors and consultants for managing cost overruns in projects. However, the client's responsibility in facilitating effective management of these factors within the project environment is crucial. Multivariate regression analysis performed on eight factors' scores highlighted the influence of five significant factors (p<5%) on managing cost overruns. The findings are expected to abridge a significant knowledge gap by shifting the priorities in cost estimation and management practices across all industry sectors. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

In particular, the total cost for a construction project is determined at the planning stage, and its estimation is very important because the decision making of the construction project owner regarding the project size, budget, and construction time depends on the total cost estimation. However, research concerned with the cost estimation for river facility construction has focused on research applicable in the early design stages rather than at the planning stage, which is the initial stage of a construction project. In addition, mainstream research has concentrated on the development of models centered on the estimation techniques being used currently in actual design engineering fields. For this reason, this study has developed an approximate construction cost estimating model for the eco-type river facility construction trade by applying Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs), which can be used at the planning stage. In order to develop the model, historical data was collected and analyzed; in order to overcome the limitations of the data collection, virtual data were also created and used. The model was developed in such a manner that it can estimate the construction cost with only eight and eleven attributes for the two eco-type trades used in the model, which can be applied at the planning stage. The results of the verification of the proposed model indicate that the model is satisfactory when applied in the approximate cost estimation of eco-type trade for river facility construction at the planning stage. It is expected that the proposed model will be applied easily and conveniently to the estimation of the approximate construction cost of eco-type trade for river facility construction at the planning stage. © 2013 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Among them, economic feasibility is the most important factor to use in selecting a road route in Korea. A proper preliminary feasibility study considers all costs incurred in the life cycle of the project, including construction costs, land acquisition costs, collateral expenses, and operation and maintenance costs. However, only construction costs are traditionally considered in the assessment of the financial viability of national road projects. In addition, while 3D modeling techniques have brought improved designs and engineering processes to the construction industries, their application in preliminary feasibility studies remains rare. We have developed a system that employs building information modeling and geographic information systems for estimating the cost of building a national road that can be applied in the preliminary feasibility stage. The proposed system is composed of three modules that estimate construction costs, land acquisition costs, and O&M costs. Based on the road route, the proposed system analyzes cross-sections through the topography and subsequently determines the probable road, bridge, and tunnel sections, and their project costs. Overall, the proposed system could assist a reasonable decision making for best route selection and further facilitate improved project delivery. © ASCE 2014."

For naval ships, AT&L (2013) concluded that contract work content growth (not capability growth) dominates total cost growth statistically. In addition, costs-over-target are significant and reflect poor cost estimation or faulty framing assumptions. AT&L (2014) also concluded prices on fixed-price contracts are only “fixed” if the contractual work content remains fixed, but this is often not the case. The authors show that under-sizing the ship during concept design studies increases ship outfit density and adds complexities to the design. These early stage design decisions on sizing the ship are a major contributor to unnecessary work content growth later in Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) that cannot be eliminated no matter how productive the shipbuilder. However, new ship design methods are being developed and integrated with legacy physics-based design and analysis tools into a Rapid Ship Design Environment (RSDE) that will enable a more rational process for initially sizing ships. The authors also identify the need for early stage design measures of complexity and ship costing tools that are more sensitive to these measures, and propose solutions that will aid decision-makers in reducing DD&C work content by making cost-effective design decisions in early stage naval ship design. © 2014 SNAME Maritime Convention 2014, SMC 2014.

A cost prediction model has also been developed using data mining for estimating final cost of projects. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach was adopted: a qualitative exploration of the causes of cost overrun followed by an empirical development of a final cost model using artificial neural networks. Findings: A conceptual model to distinguish between the often conflated causes of underestimation and cost overruns on large publicly funded projects. The empirical model developed in this paper achieved an average absolute percentage error of 3.67 percent with 87 percent of the model predictions within a range of ±5 percent of the actual final cost. Practical implications: The model developed can be converted to a desktop package for quick cost predictions and the generation of various alternative solutions for a construction project in a sort of what-if analysis for the purposes of comparison. The use of the model could also greatly reduce the time and resources spent on estimation.

Among the common methods and some new ways which have appeared in recent years, people can find about seven types out of them, in which, neural network model is known for its versatility and adaptability. It does not exclude new sample. On the contrary, it improves its ability to generalize and forecast with the increasing number of samples. Therefore this paper establish a cost estimation model by introducing neural network which is based on the optimization of genetic algorithm, and expresses the relationship implied in the interior of data by using the network topology and parameters by studying a large number of samples so as to fit the conventional non-linear mapping relationship between the amount and cost of a transmission line project.

The main problems in the traditional design of wharves have been identified as soil-pile interaction and torsional eccentricity due to the asymmetry in the distribution of rigidity of the structure. Fifty-two seismic isolators have been incorporated in the most rigid piles of a typical wharf section and compared with the conventional structure. The soil-structure interaction has been modeled with P-Y curves from real scale test of piles on sloping ground conditions and geotechnical studies that consider the effect of sloping ground condition over the piles. By means of seismic isolators and flexibility of the longest piles of the wharf, a hybrid structure able to minimize the torsional eccentricity and to achieve a fundamental period of 3 seconds has been configured. Through the mentioned structure, the X and Y seismic coefficients have been reduced by 50% and 56% respectively, relative to the conventional wharf, allowing significant savings in the wharf elements. The cost estimation outcome has shown the isolated wharf piles are US$0.53 million lower than the traditional wharf, the isolated wharf platform is 0.81MUSD lower than the conventional wharf, and the isolation system (52 rubber isolators) cost is 0.29MUSD. In general, the direct cost of the seismic isolated wharf is 16% less than the cost of a traditional wharf while allowing for enhanced structural performance with insignificant damage during a severe seismic event.

The proposed ontological approach can help engineers to find work items with greater ease and consistency. Suggestions are also made for further research on ways of improving the accuracy of BIM-based quantity take-off, and developing a methodology to match between work items which are expressed as different terms; however, the proposed approach emphasizes the automation of searches using BIM data to find items suitable for building elements and materials. To enable automated inference, this study establishes (1) a work condition ontology that consists of the determinants required to select work items, (2) a work item ontology, which consists of the factors defining the tiling method, and (3) semantic reasoning rules. By conducting a case study to demonstrate the proposed ontological inference process in a real-world situation, we confirm that the proposed process can provide consistent results; however, since work items differ depending on construction type and technological advancement, the work item ontology should be continually revised and updated. The ontological inference process removes the need for the intervention of a cost estimator's subjectivity in searching for an appropriate work item. Also, if ontology is elaborately defined by the knowledge of experienced engineers, then accurate and consistent results can be obtained.

Design/methodology/approach – To develop the proposed system, data pertaining to 54 sewer and water rehabilitation projects was collected. The collected data were analyzed using Pareto analysis technique to identify the most important factors that contribute positively to the cost estimation process. These factors were then utilized to develop a neural network (NN) model that estimates the construction cost of this class of projects. Findings – The study reveals a set of 23 factors that highly impact the construction cost of water and sewer network rehabilitation projects and presents a NN model that predicts the cost of these projects with high accuracy. Research limitations/implications – The proposed system was developed using information obtained from the city of San Diego, California, USA. The cost of these projects ranged from $800,000 to $7 million. The diameter of pipes installed in these projects ranged from 1 in. to 36 in. and their length was up to about 2.7 miles. Originality/value – The developed system saves time, improves the accuracy of the estimates and prevents problems that are usually associated with inaccurate estimates. The system will not only help funding authorities to ensure maximum utilization of resources, but will also help cities to manage their expenditures in a manner that assures satisfactory performance of their buried assets. Furthermore, the developed system is also believed to assist cities in comparing alternatives and the go/no-go decision making process. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

Addressing this development within our industry is Building Information Modelling (BIM). The currency of inter-dependent cooperation within BIM and the construction industry is information. However, cost estimators still have little knowledge about how to leverage information within semantic rich information models, e.g. IFC. This paper introduces a new philosophic stance for cost estimation to address the development of model-based cost estimation. It addresses the importance of contextual information and the needs of extension of pricing information according to the general process of cost estimation by using the IFC standard. Information requirement, as specified in IFC for cost estimation, is established and instances of IFC relationship have been identified. The knowledge of cost estimation is demonstrated and discussed. Initial analysis of the IFC schema has been completed, including analysis classification & inheritance structure. It can be concluded that the IFC standard has the capacity fully facilitate the cost estimation within an ideal environment, and the direction of automating cost estimation for BIM has been pointed out. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

In this paper, a model for cost estimation of forest roads is presented, based on the standard engineering properties of cross sections and the location-specific parameters of terrain slope and vegetation information. The model assumes six main cost elements of clearing operations, embankment, pavement, grading, culverts and ditch for total construction cost calculation. To validate the performance, the outputs of the model were compared with the experts' prediction for an existing forest road project in a mountain condition. The final result of the research showed that the model could estimate total cost of road construction in an accuracy range of ±6.5%. The results of the validation process showed a 66.51% underestimate for clearing operation, 3.56% underestimate for embankment, 3.85% underestimate for surfacing, 3.32% underestimate for culverts, 20.54% underestimate for ditch excavation, and 22.33% overestimate for grading of the cut slope and travel way.

This element is even more important at the initial stages of design where decisions should be taken based on the more accurately available cost data. In underground construction projects especially, where the variability of the geotechnical conditions can change initial estimates, the accurate estimation of the construction cost from the preliminary phases of the project can minimize cost overrun issues as well construction claims and disputes. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight in cost estimation for underground projects focusing on tunnels. For this reason, the analysis of construction cost is undertaken, based on data from a set of 9 tunnels that have been constructed in Greece. The analysis presented focuses on the excavation and temporary support cost with respect to the geotechnical conditions encountered. Although the cost is influenced by many parameters, through the analysis of past data using the Case Base Reasoning approach, valuable lessons can be learned by decoding the effect of the ground conditions on the construction cost. The construction cost of the Greek tunnels is estimated for 2011 price levels and it is expressed though range estimation for 5 rock mass categories that were identified. Furthermore, a direct linkage between construction cost and the encountered geotechnical conditions, as expressed in GSI values, are made in an attempt to capture the general trend of construction cost in terms of €/m3 and €/m. The findings can be used as a first order assessment in order to have a representative estimation of the tunneling cost from the initial stages of project design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

First, the extracted cost factors (CFs) of a high-rise building were shown to significantly improve the cost estimation system's performance. For developing a CBR system, a hybrid approach that combines CBR with genetic algorithms (GAs) for cost estimation was adopted. Genetic algorithms were used for optimized weight generation and applied to real project cases. Additionally, this paper proposes the identification of an alternative similarity score measurement formula. The proposed formula evaluates the contrast between the alternative case matching approach and the classical formula in a scenario involving the use of cost factors describing a case. The results indicate that the proposed GA-based CBR system can consistently reduce errors and potentially be useful to owners and contractors in the early financial planning stage. Accordingly, it is expected that the developed CBR system would provide decision-makers with accurate cost information to assess and compare multiple alternatives for obtaining the optimal solution and controlling the cost."

This paper proposes a knowledge-based risk mapping tool for systematically assessing risk-related variables that may lead to cost overrun in international markets. The tool uses an ontology that relates risk and vulnerability to cost overrun [1] and a novel risk-vulnerability assessment methodology [2] to estimate potential risk paths that may emerge in international construction projects. The tool has been developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, a construction management company that gives risk management consultancy services to Turkish contractors working in international markets. The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool. As the reliability and usability of the tool significantly depend on the subjective evaluations of users about level of vulnerability and magnitude of potential risk events, a lessons learned database has been incorporated into the tool so that decision-makers may refer to risk event histories of previous projects to make estimations about forthcoming projects. In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool. Although the usability and reliability test results are satisfactory, the tool should be seen as an initial platform which should be improved by increasing its ""intelligence"" by high quality and enough number of risk event histories, and also customized according to user preferences as well as company policies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With the development of information technology, it is expected that the efficiency and accuracy of cost estimation for tendering of building projects (TBP cost estimation for short hereafter) can be greatly improved if it can be carried out automatically based on the design results using building information modeling (BIM-based design results for short hereafter). One of the major obstacle to realize the automatic TBP cost estimation is the acquisition of the construction information (e.g. construction method, equipment), which are necessary for TBP cost estimation but often not included in the design results. This paper aims to establish an approach to identify and acquire the construction information systematically in order to facilitate the automatic TBP cost estimation based on BIM-based design results. First, the process of TBP cot estimation based on BQ method in China is introduced and the related specifications are classified. Then a typical specification for TBP cost estimation is analyzed to identify the construction information that are required in TBP cost estimation and a typical specification for the requirement on design detail fulfillment is analyzed to identify the construction information that can be obtained from the design result. Next, based on the above results, the construction information that need to be established during TBP cost estimation are highlighted and an approach to acquire them based on BIM-based design results are presented. Finally, the applicability of the approach is discussed.

The reference class forecasting was introduced to counter this bias. However, the precise workings or cost over-run determinants are however still under-researched. We selected the case of the National Highway Construction Program in Slovenia and projects, completed between 1995 and 2007. The purpose was to determine the precise cost performance through time and analyze the cost estimating mechanism to see whether and how it influences the cost performance. The details of the cost estimating practice have been studied and compared with the existing practice in the USA and elsewhere. A representative sample of 36 projects could be constructed, valued at USD 2.7 billion (2006 prices) with a total length of some 235. km. Almost half of the cost performance variance could be explained by the cost estimation mechanism (cost-based estimation with historic bid database). In different variants, this approach appears to be dominant in the most developed countries of the World due to its relative simplicity. We find, that due to the behavior of bidders in the tendering process, the same mechanism also implies that some systematic cost over-run will likely occur, even if no other causes were present. This adds a new perspective to the suggestions of Flyvbjerg and others, who suggested that the dominant (but not exclusive) cause for the persistence of systematic cost is strategic misinterpretation. The findings suggest that project sponsors should perform a supporting analysis on how price changes on the construction market feed in to the cost performance to further support the reference class forecasting approach. The findings also suggests, that in case of strong cost performance shifts, longer periods need to be included in the analysis, before one can conclude, that the improvement or worsening is not temporary and is not the inherent result of the cost estimating mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

One of the essential assignments for materials' prices prediction is to control the cost of inventory. Even though the prediction system based on support vector machine (SVM) recently has been emerged as a favourable choice, the prediction accuracy of SVM is usually deteriorated with nonstationary price data. Thus the way to explore workable price prediction still remains a challenge to be resolved for materials' cost control. In this paper, an enhanced online least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed to predict the trend of building materials prices. Our design is to incorporate with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to deconstruct nonlinear and nonstationary data for the set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are represented in sinusoidlike waveforms. Superior prediction, therefore, can be attained by predicting IMFs with online LS-SVMs. According to our simulation results, proposed EMD designs notably improve prediction accuracy from online LS-SVM and are workable for the cost estimation of building materials."

A key element of process planning that is not generated from a typical computer-aided process plan (CAPP) is the process time standards. Generative process planning that includes time standards is particularly needed in the construction steel building (CSB) industry due to variability in projects (orders) size and content. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to focus on incorporating time standards into CAPP of CSB. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical formulas are developed to generate time standards for variant steel beams based on their CAD files (design parameters and geometry) and process parameters (operational conditions). A Motion and Time Study (MTS) is used to estimate times for manual work elements such as load/unload activities and to validate the generated time standards. A generic parametric model is developed with Excel and integrated into the CAPP system to automatically estimate the standard time of each process operation. Findings - Results showed that developing the time standards module for process operations and integrating its spreadsheets into a generative CAPP has helped process planners to arrive at better estimates of process parameters and has helped production management and the overall project management process in CSB industry. Practical implications - The application of the proposed approach is not limited to CSB industry but it can also contribute to the continuing growth of CAPP applications in other industries. Originality/value - The study is unique since it incorporates time standards into the architecture of CAPP system for accurate time and cost estimation and effective resource allocation and project management and it utilizes motion and time study (MTS) to collect complementary process data and validate the model-generated cycle times. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In the course of the research the author focused on regression models binding together the basic information about residential buildings available in the early stage of design and construction cost. Application of different neural networks types was analysed (multilayer perceptron, multilayer perceptron with data compression based on principal component analysis and radial basis function networks). Due to the research results, multilayer perceptron networks proved to be the best neural network type for the problem solution.

In the design of desilting tank, various combinations of width, depth, and length of the tank are possible to achieve desired silt removal efficiency. In the present study, an attempt has been made to develop correlations for sizing of desilting tank and estimation of quantities of various materials required in the construction of desilting tank.

Cost analysis of construction work items is essential to a cost estimating process for contractors. However, current cost analysis tasks cannot be implemented effectively in practices. Therefore, this study proposes an ontology-based representation framework that aims to address such practical problems. The framework can be used to establish a cost analysis knowledge base which can benefit the modeling and application of cost analysis knowledge and hence, improve the accuracy of cost analysis and estimation. This framework is developed by using the ontological modeling technique with which key cost items of cost analysis and relationships among these cost items can be modeled and subsequently be examined. Actual cost analysis information of eight cases were collected and used to demonstrate and validate the framework. The case study results show that the proposed representation framework can effectively model and store cost analysis knowledge from both historical data as well as current professional work. Furthermore, the modeled cost analysis knowledge can be reused in new cost analysis tasks, and the accuracy and efficiency of cost analysis and estimates can be improved by eliminating the possibility of leaving out necessary cost breakdown items. Future research is suggested on improving the framework by developing a reasoning mechanism that can automate cost analysis processes of reusing existing cost analysis knowledge."

To address this challenge, this study aimed to develop a decision support system for determining the optimal size of a new ESA, focusing on the profitability of the ESA. This study adopted a case-based reasoning approach as the main research method because it is necessary to provide the historical data as a reference in determining the optimal size of a new ESA, which is more suitable for the decision-making process from the practical perspective. This study used a total of 106 general ESAs to develop the proposed system.

The computational time required for the optimization of the proposed system was determined to be less than 10 min (from 1.75 min to 9.93 min). The proposed system could be useful for the final decision-maker as the following purposes: (i) the probability estimation model for determining the optimal size of a new ESA during the planning stage; (ii) the approximate initial construction cost estimation model for a new ESA by using the estimated sales in the ESA; and (iii) the comparative assessment model for evaluating the sales per the building area of the existing ESA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The capability to extract or deduce such quantitative properties from explicit and implicit model information is essential for bidding, procurement, production planning, and cost control activities in the AEC projects. Current solutions for quantity take off (QTO) and cost estimation (CE) are developed based on the assumptions that the design models are suitable, contain adequate information to perform these tasks efficiently and accurately. In practice often these criteria do not exist in the models that cost estimators receive. Many estimators, engineers and managers distrust BIM operations as a result or find it difficult to adopt a BIM-based preconstruction process. This leads to a cumbersome, manual and error-prone QT and CE process currently used by most construction companies. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we have developed a framework for a knowledge-based system to perform model based QTO and CE. This framework includes domain, reasoning, task and interface layers. This paper reports on the progress on an ongoing research effort which so far mostly focused on developing a domain layer and rule libraries for the reasoning layer. The domain layer contains a knowledge base which along with rule libraries were developed by acquiring and representing domain experts' knowledge. The rule libraries include modules of rules to infer knowledge about different product features. The inferred knowledge will enable providing and representing model information in a compatible format for QTO and CE tasks. It facilitates filtering, grouping and representing feature information provided in design models based on criteria that determines their true cost behavior. Finally, this knowledge will enable forecasting the properties of product features absent from design models. Examples are drawn from various fields inside and outside of the AEC industry, with a focus on the precast concrete industry."

State transportation agencies strive to manage these efforts efficiently, seeking to maximize the utilization of limited funding and workforce productivity. Managers need a feasible PE budget, considering both cost and time, early in project development. The results reported herein will provide engineers and managers with a comparative investigation evaluating different strategies for establishing a PE budget during the preconstruction phase of roadway project development. Cost data were obtained for 188 North Carolina roadway projects built between 1999 and 2009. An analysis of the North Carolina DOT data yielded an overall mean ratio of PE cost to estimated construction cost (the PE cost ratio) of 11.7%. The multiple linear regression model was used to develop prediction models to forecast the PE cost ratio of future roadway projects. It was found that while differing regression strategies could reduce prediction error, the improvement was small. In terms of simplicity, using the historical means applicable for widening projects (13.3%), rehabilitation/resurfacing projects (7.7%), and new location/interchange projects (16.5%) proved advantageous over regression modeling because a project manager would not have to estimate any project-specific values at the earliest stages of project development. The lowest of these historical means was significantly different than the two higher means (7.7% versus 13.3% and 16.5%); however, the difference between the two higher means (13.3% versus 16.5%) was not statistically significant. The study analyses also found a significant correlation between a project's PE cost ratio and its PE duration, suggesting that further investigation into PE duration of transportation projects is warranted. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The coefficient of determination (r2) of the developed models is ranging from 0.65 to 0.97. This indicates that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables of the developed models is good and the predicted values from a forecast model fit with the real-life data. The value of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the developed regression models is tested. It is ranging from 17% to 42%. The results compare favorably with past researches which have shown that the estimate accuracy in the early stages of a project is between ±25% and ±50%.

These variations are problematic for cost estimation, bid preparation, and investment planning. The accurate prediction of CCI can be invaluable for cost estimation and budgeting of capital projects, and can result in accurate bids. The research objective of this paper is to create appropriate multivariate time series models for forecasting CCI based on a group of explanatory variables that are identified by using Granger causality tests. The results of cointegration tests recommend vector error correction (VEC) models as the proper type of multivariate time series models to forecast CCI. Several VEC models are created and compared with existing univariate time series models for forecasting CCI. It is shown that the CCI predicted by these VEC models is more accurate than that predicted by the previously proposed univariate models (i.e., seasonal autoregressive integrated mean-average and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing). The comparisons are based on two typical error measures: mean absolute prediction error and mean squared error. The primary contribution of this research to the body of knowledge is the creation of multivariate time series models that are more accurate than the current univariate time series models for forecasting CCI.

Numerous variables influence the cost of tunnel construction and limited information is available at early stages of design when the possible use of tunnels is being studied. Therefore, there is limited number of models at engineers' disposal for development of a proper cost estimate in tunneling projects. The focus of this study was to offer a model for estimation of the construction cost of tunnels for various applications in the preliminary stage of a project. The work is based on study of nearly 270 projects and statistical analysis of the recoded construction costs, tunnel size, ground conditions, and tunnel applications. Several cost estimation models are introduced for various tunnel types including waste water, water, and transportation tunnels in soft ground and rock. The model uses commonly available cost indices (CCI and BCI) to adjust the estimated costs for the time and location of the project. The proposed cost models presented in this study can included in a simple program to help users make more accurate and quick cost estimates for their future projects. The models do not deal with construction risk which is an essential part of the study of various methods and should be done through developing a risk registry with related cost of each case before final selection, design, and cost estimation of any tunneling project. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

The study started from determination of work elements of precast concrete slab installation work, after that the time data for each work element were collected from construction site to meet 95% confidence interval and 5% limit of error. The Multiple-Activity-Chart then was created, using average time required for each work element, to derive for cycle time of installation work. The alternated tool, EZStrobe simulation system, then was introduced to determine for cycle time by creating a model with stochastic time data. The results, in term of basic cycle time and idle time percentages, from simulation had been compared with deterministic method, Multiple-Activity-Chart model, which validated that EZStrobe simulation system could well represent the construction process. After that, more complicated model was created to see the effectiveness of the system by simulating more realistic site conditions e.g. limited space for hollow-core slab truck in site, number of precast concrete slab per truck. The required results; basic cycle time (min), standard cycle time (min), productivity (pieces/day and square meter/day), and unit cost (Baht/piece); were also formulated in this new model. These outcomes were very useful for construction planning, scheduling and unit cost estimation. Furthermore, the EZStrobe simulation system could give the insight understanding of construction processes for work study and improvement.

Using 1600 water infrastructure projects completed between 2004 and 2012 within the UK, cost predictive models were developed using a combination of data mining techniques such as factor analysis, optimal binning and scree tests. These were combined with the learning and generalising capabilities of artificial neural network to develop the final cost models. The best model achieved an average absolute percentage error of 3.67% with 87% of the validation predictions falling within an error range of ±5%.

This particular aspect of cost has largely been neglected because of the difficulty in obtaining appropriate data. Typically, PE costs are determined as a percentage of construction costs, disregarding other project-specific parameters. Bridge projects let by the North Carolina (NC) DOT between 2001 and 2009 were reviewed. From an analysis of these 461 projects, the writers developed statistical models linking variation in PE costs with distinctive project parameters. The primary contribution this paper makes to the body of knowledge is the finding that PE cost estimates for bridge projects are commonly and significantly underestimated. The writers found that bridge projects exhibited a mean PE cost ratio of 28%. This result is significantly greater than the percentage used in practice. An investigation of data sources related to bridge projects, a description of regression techniques applied to predict the PE cost of such projects, and an assessment of the predictive performance of models are addressed in this paper. New knowledge contributions include identification of key factors affecting the PE costs of bridges, illustration of how those key factors enabled us to predict PE costs of future projects, and discussion of the data collection problems that hindered model development. The writers' PE cost analyses and predictive modeling effort relate to infrastructure funding issues. All of the parties involved in infrastructure construction, from legislators to contractors, must understand costs and have confidence in the cost estimates developed to ensure efficient and effective funding of infrastructure projects.

The 3D models are also used as basis for tunnel and cavern layout. As detailed designs of components become available, the lattice is adjusted and the overall models are iterated. Lists of components are derived from the lattice and are used to generate a component bill of materials, which in turn serves as basis for cost estimation and installation planning.

Well construction cost estimates often contain high levels of uncertainty. In many cases, these costs are estimated using deterministic methods that do not reliably account for uncertainty, leading to biased estimates. The objectives of this work were to improve the reliability of deterministic well construction cost estimates by incorporating external probabilistic methods into the estimation process. The method uses historical well cost estimates and actual costs to develop probabilistic correction factors that can be applied to future well cost estimates. These factors can be applied to the entire well cost or to individual cost components. Application of the methodology to estimation of well construction costs for horizontal Barnett shale wells in the Fort Worth basin resulted in estimated well cost estimates that were well-calibrated probabilistically. Overall, average estimated well cost using this methodology was significantly more accurate than average estimated well cost using deterministic methods. The methodology is intended for use by individual engineers to improve their well construction cost estimation and by management to externally revise and improve well cost estimates for budgeting purposes. Systematic use of this methodology will provide for more accurate and efficient allocation of capital for drilling campaigns, which could have significant impacts on reservoir development and profitability.

Various plan asymmetric variants, with different realistic distributions of the payload mass and occupancy levels, have been investigated under two seismic intensities. The results obtained are presented as floor plan projection envelopes of the top displacements and as plastic hinge damage patterns of the superstructure. In the presented cost evaluation, the cost of the implementation of the proposed base isolation system is compared with the estimated costs of structural repairs to the damaged structural members of the superstructure, as well as with estimated expenses of the downtime period and content damage. The results have shown that base isolation is, in general, not economically feasible for lower ground motion intensities, whereas it could be of great benefit in the case of moderate and high intensities. A simple rough cost estimation study, based on the obtained plastic hinge patterns, showed that the inclusion of the downtime period costs and content damage costs might be important parameters, which - if taken into account - could make such an isolation system viable also for lower ground motion intensities. The other benefits brought by seismic isolation, such as savings on the building design costs, reductions in the threat to employees' lives, and others, were, however, not included in the presented study.

Information about 150 villas was collected from six well experienced consultants in the field of villa design and supervision in Oman. Collected data was analyzed to develop suggested model which consists of two main levels of estimate. The first level is at the conceptual design stage where the client presents his/her need of space and basic information about the available plot for construction. The second level of cost estimation is carried out after the preliminary design stage where the client has to decide on the finishes and type of structure. At the second level of estimation, the client should be able to decide whether to precede for construction or not, according to his/her budget. The model is general and can be used anywhere and was validated for accepted degree of confidence using the actual cost of the 112 executed villa projects in Oman.

Despite its proven importance, it is common to see a construction project failing to achieve its objectives within the specific cost. Cost variation is a very frequent phenomenon and is almost associated with nearly constructing all wastewater projects. Maintaining steady cost projection on wastewater projects had been recently an issue of serious concern, both to the client and project contractors. Cost deviation from initial cost plan had been prevalent on construction sites. However, little or no effort has been made to curtail the phenomenon, this research work attempts to identify, investigate and rank factors perceived to affect cost variation in the Egyptian wastewater projects with respect to their relative importance so as to proffer possible ways of coping with this phenomenon. To achieve this objective, author invited practitioners and experts, comprising a statistically representative sample, to participate in a structured questionnaire survey. Brain storming was taken into consideration, through which a number of cost variation factors were identified for constructing wastewater projects. Totally 52 factors were short-listed to be made part of the questionnaire survey and the survey was conducted with experts and representatives from private, public and local general construction firms. The data were analyzed using Relative Importance Index, ranking and simple percentages. It was analytically discovered that factors such as: (1) Lowest bidding procurement method; (2) Additional work; (3) Bureaucracy in bidding/tendering method; (4) Wrong method of cost estimation; and (5) Funding problems were critical for causing cost variation, while (1) Inaccurate cost estimation; (2) Mode of financing and payment for completed work; (3) Unexpected ground conditions; (4) Inflation; and (5) Fluctuation in prices of raw materials are also responsible. The study concluded with recommending, ensuring adequate and available source of finance, allocating sufficient time and funding the design phase while cost estimators should be aware of the problems, but must not allow to deflect them from their primary tasks, which must always use all data and time available to produce the best possible estimate, improve owner's project management procedures, material bulk purchase, establishing fraudulent system of individual accountability to discourage stealing and other related vices, adequate planning by breaking project planning into short term achievable goals, medium term planning and long term planning, and through estimation process for projects cost calculations, with vigilant planning, keeping in view trends of inflation and depreciation factors, construction cost variation trends in wastewater projects with lead to smoother implementation and achievement of desired cost control. Also, this paper serves as a guide and reference for contractors and construction managers for more effective management in constructing wastewater projects to achieve a competitive level of quality and a cost effective project. © 2013 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

If the contractor's bidding price is set higher than that of a competitor due to cost estimation error, the contractor could fail to receive the order. Conversely, if the cost estimation error results in an underestimation of the cost, the contractor would be granted the order; however, he would eventually suffer a loss on this order. Thus, a bidding price decision in consideration of the cost estimation accuracy and the deficit order probability is essential for the contractor in EPC projects. In this paper, we develop a two-step bidding price decision algorithm. It allocates MH (Man-Hour) for cost estimation, which determines the cost estimation accuracy, to each order under the limited volume of MH, and then determines the bidding price for maximizing the expected profit under the deficit order probability constraint. Numerical examples show that the bidding price decision in consideration of the cost estimation accuracy and the deficit order probability is essential for the contractor to make a stable profit in EPC projects, and that the developed algorithm is effective for making such bidding price decision."

Rig weight is generally considered proprietary because it indicates design benchmarks and performance metrics that are central to the competitive nature of the construction industry. Methods to predict ship weight cannot be used for jackups because of the structural differences between jackup rigs and ships.

The study presented in this paper aims at predicting this cost by employing a more advanced modeling technique known as the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology. Using this methodology, a series of nonparametric ANN models was developed based on significant predictors of the retrofit net construction cost (RNCC). Data on these predictors, together with the RNCC, were collected from 158 earthquake-prone public school buildings, each having a framed structure. A novel systematic framework was proposed with the aim to increase the generalization ability of ANN models. Using this framework, the values of critical components involved in the design of ANN models were defined. These components included the number of hidden layers and neurons, and learning parameters in terms of learning rate and momentum. The sensitivity of the developed ANN models to these components was examined, and it was found that the predictive performance of these models was more influenced by the number of hidden neurons than by the value of learning parameters. Also, the results of this examination revealed that the overlearning problem became more serious with an increase in the number of predictors. In addition to the framework proposed for the successful development of ANN models, the primary contribution of this study to the construction industry is the introduction of building total area as the key predictor of the RNCC. This predictor enables a reliable estimation of the RNCC to be made at the early development stage of a seismic retrofit project when little information is known about the project. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Unfortunately, such (low-visibility) factors are neglected or ignored by current prediction models.

The research was carried out by studying relevant literature and conducting nine semi-structured indepth interviews with key design and construction personnel on two case studies selected from the Norwegian construction industry. Previous research demonstrates that projects benefits from multi-disciplinary collaboration through all project phases. However, little research has been found concerning how early contractor involvement affects the work of the design team. The analysis documented in this paper show that there are several distinct advantages for the design team when contractors are involved early. The positive implications include not only improved cost estimation, planning, constructability and risk management, but also a reduced amount of errors and changes in latter phases. Unquestionably, the premises governing the design process will change with early contractor involvement. Contractors intervene into a process which used to belong to designers and architects. Designers can thereby experience a challenge of their interests, as contractors are typically perceived to have a distinct focus on constructability, cost and schedule. It is vital with an acceptance and dedication among the team members to adhere to new forms of collaboration. The contract must give incentives for both parties, and the early contractor involvement has to gain all parties in order to succeed."

Cost estimation, for example, is an essential task for successful project management involving a high level of uncertainty. It is not surprising, therefore, that young cost estimators especially can become stressful at work due to a lack of experience and the heavy responsibilities involved. However, the concept of work stress and the associated underlying dimensions has not been clearly defined in extant studies in the construction management field. To redress this situation, an updated psychology perceived stress questionnaire (PSQ), first developed by Levenstein et al (1993) and revised by Fliege et al (2005), is used to explore the dimensions of work stress with empirical evidence from the construction industry in China. With 145 reliable responses from young (less than 5 years' experience) Chinese cost estimators, this study explores the internal dimensions of work stress, identifying four dimensions of tension, demands, lack of joy and worries. It is suggested that this four-dimensional structure may also be applicable in a more general context."

A framework of marketing risks has been devised to help the third party personnel during sales of completed or under process civil projects. These risks have been evaluated by the sales managers and site engineers through survey process. Last three decades have witnessed the Chinese economy growing at very rapid rate especially for massive construction developments. Rapid developments in building designs, customers ever changing demands, state policies and geographical locations have made the marketing strategies risk prone in China. Marketing concept was introduced during 60s to get the cmpettive advanteges by business moguls. His concepts caused a paradigm shift in business concept to suggests that business should satisfy their customer's needs which are the heart of business. Customer's loyalty and satisfaction were put at first in priority.

The approach is composed of several components: Query Representation, Query Optimisation, Automatic Rule Derivation and Rule Maintenance. This paper focused on the query optimisation component. In RDMSs, during the traditional SQO, different alternative queries of a given query can be constructed using matching rule(s) from the rule set, and then its optimiser selects one of the alternatives as an optimum query which will give the same answer set but it can be executed faster than the original query. One of the main problems occurs during this process is to have many matched rules e.g., if the number of the rules is N, the number of the alternative queries is 2N -1. The construction and the optimisation of these alternatives also take time in addition to the execution of the query. In order to overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new Rule Evaluation Algorithm. The main goal of the algorithm is to evaluate matching rule(s) and select useful/promising rules. And then use selected rules to construct an optimum query. The algorithm can answer the question of the utility of rules in the query optimisation. The system of the approach based on the algorithm has been implemented and its computational results are given. The experimental results show that the algorithm can trim the number of the rules significantly. © 2013 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor."

Nowadays there exist some problems in the cost risk management of construction project ,such as the disjoint between the construction cost management and the entire construction operation, the management personnel's professional qualities and cost risk management abilities are not high enough. Lacking of the effective management method of project cost risk is the main reason of these problems.

As part of the Colorado Water Conservation Board's (CWCB) Statewide Water Supply Initiative, CWCB developed reconnaissance-level cost estimates for several pipelines that have been discussed by various entities across the state. The scale of the proposed pipelines is significant, conveying large flows from across the Continental Divide, and even across state lines, to the eastern edge of the Rockies where most of the state's population is concentrated. To compare these major projects, CWCB and CDM developed planning-level cost estimates with considerable detail given the long term of the planning horizon. This comprehensive effort required collaboration between planning engineers and experts in design and construction cost estimation. Many of the unit costs were developed using existing tools intended for design phases. Care was taken to make the methodologies and the tools transferrable to other projects. This unique reconnaissance-level cost estimating project is thus relevant to water supply planners, and anyone interested in the early stages of large pipeline projects or pipeline cost estimation in general. © 2011 ASCE."

Thus, the demands on 1/5.000 topographic map revision in 18 administrative tasks such as city and district management planning were surveyed in three local autonomous entities. Then the cost to alternatively fulfill the demands was estimated with the standard construction estimating system for the field surveying and surveying results in commercial OIS companies for the site investigation. With this cost estimation model, the benefit of the current national map revision program to the local autonomous entities was estimated as 265,960,999 won.

In German practice, the first stage cost estimation is performed at the pre-design stage where no design details exist. Thus, the practical relevance of any model to be developed that requires further design information, would be questionable. The German norms describe construction cost elements as the subcategories for cost of construction works. Therefore, the accuracy of the first stage estimate can be improved by modelling construction cost elements where more detailed information incorporates. In this context, it is aimed to demonstrate the development of a predictive model for the most relevant cost element: external walls. Historical data was randomly sampled from Building Cost Information Centre (Baukosteninformationszentrum) database. The most significant predictors for cost of external walls were determined by backwards regression method. Multiple linear regression methodology is employed for the final parameter estimation. The results reveal that substantial variation in the cost of external walls can be explained by the proposed model which leads to high prediction accuracy. The development of the model is anticipated to influence further studies that address cost modelling in Germany. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

This research proposes a framework to investigate the reasons and their respective production change and redesign costs for design changes during production. It analyses 339 change items and interviews designers, owners and contractors of seven construction projects. Research findings show that design changes result from three categories of reasons: under owner's, designer's, and beyond control. The proportions of change reasons, construction change costs and redesign costs are different for the studied projects. The redesign costs are from 2.1% to 21.5% and on average 8.5% of the construction change cost, equivalent to the fee of a new design project. The identified reasons with quantitative cost behaviours can help clarify design change problems. Insight about design change can also be gained through the convergence of different perceptions of change reason proportions from project participants.

Accurate cost estimate is the single most important element involved in the series of events that leads to a profitable completion of a contract in constmction industry. The success or failure of a project depends on the accuracy of cost estimation. A cost estimate becomes more difficult and more complicated under inflationary medium. An unpredictable inflation rate and long progress payment delay during this period makes the budgeting function very difficult, if not impossible. The cost estimation process uses lots of data. The availability of the appropriate data at the appropriate time is one of the main factors affecting the accuracy of the cost estimation. As the complexity of the estimating task increases computerized system becomes increasingly important. The estimator should develop a good system of estimating forms and procedures that exactly meet the requirements of the project, and that is understood and accessible by all team members. This system should provide the ability to define material, labor hour and equipment hour quantities required for the project. Material, labor, and equipment unit costs are then applied to the bill of quantities. This paper presents An Integrated Web-Based Data Warehouse and Artificial Neural Networks Model for Unit Price Analysis with Inflation Adjustment system called ""DANUP"". Web facilities and database management capabilities of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 are applied to create a data warehouse which is mainly aimed to integrate data from multiple heterogeneous databases and other information sources. The System also supports integrated cost index for adjusting the effect of inflation during estimating process. An artificial neural network model for forecasting the cost indices in Turkey for the project period has been developed. A consiruction project takes relatively long time to complete, effective communication among the project participants during the project period is important. A web based system is developed to facilitate the collection of constmction cost information and communication. The web based system focuses on demonstrating the potential of data centric web data bases in enhancing the communication process during project execution.

These time and cost estimations are based so far on partially inaccurate correlations in terms of the interactions among formwork related teams. Elementary processes which are interacting with other elementary processes may produce waiting times which cannot be considered in the general performance factors commonly used for the time estimations. The new approach performs a modified CYCLONE-analysis so that the geometrical properties of the construction site as well as the working group properties can be considered in order to assess the waiting time quota. This analysis fits into the formwork-selection-model newly developed by the ETH Zurich in cooperation with Swiss industrial partners. Through the use of the formwork-selection-model expanded with the modified CYCLONE-analysis construction companies can now identify the optimal formwork system in order to minimize their project specific operation costs.

Germany's public sector is restricted by tendering regulations resulting in a strict design-bid-build tendering. These legal regulations, as well as contractual penalties, create an incentive structure which often leads to uncooperative behavior of the project partners. This paper identifies the negative incentives of strict design-bid-build tendering and explains their effects on projects. Data was collected from one public authority, and data shows that contractors are selected based on lowest bid. Thus, we argue that this tendering procedure leads to speculative behavior of the contractors, which results in unrealistic cost estimation and an intensified focus on claim management to compensate for below-cost bids. Furthermore, the design-bid-build tendering procedure strictly separates planning and execution phases, resulting in communication barriers between architects and construction companies. With regard to the non-collaborative up to hostile behavior three current public mega projects in Germany will be reviewed in brief, and of these the project Elbphilharmonie Hamburg will be discussed in more depth based on the tendering procedure and the contractual situation. We conclude that due to increasing uncertainty and complexity in projects, as well as the way of interaction between the project parties, that the current tendering procedure and the form of contracts impede collaboration. Therefore, incentives are needed which foster the collaboration in public projects."

Accuracy of construction cost estimates remains a contentious area of debate within both academia and industry. Explanations for this have ranged from scope changes, risk and uncertainty, optimism bias, technical and managerial difficulties, suspicions of corruption, lying and insufficient required information for accurate estimation. The capacity for tolerance and imprecise knowledge representation of fuzzy set theory is combined with the learning and generalising capabilities of neural networks to develop neuro-fuzzy hybrid cost models in this paper to predict likely final cost of water infrastructure projects. The will help to increase reliability, flexibility and accuracy of initial cost estimates. Neural networks is first used to develop relative numerical weightings of cost predictors extracted from primary data collected on 98 completed projects. These were then standardised into fuzzy sets to establish a consistent framework for combining the effect of each variable on the overall final cost. A three-point fuzzy lower, upper and mean estimate of likely final cost is generated to provide a tolerance range for final cost rather than the traditional single point estimate. The performance of the final models ranged from 3.3% underestimation to 1.6 % overestimation. The best models however averaged an error of 0.6% underestimation and 0.8% overestimation of final cost of the project. The results are now being extended to a larger database of about 4500 projects in collaboration with an industry partner."

In particular, recent volatile fluctuations of construction material prices have fueled problems like cost forecasting. Many researchers try to accurately estimate cost escalations, but price forecasting for numerous construction materials requires a simplified and automated process. The research in this paper develops an automated time-series material cost forecasting (ATMF) system including both autoselected procedures for determining a best-fitting model and an autoextracting module for forecasting values using the Box-Jenkins approach. If the modeling process is simplified and iterative arbitrary decisions for the modeler eliminated, each future prices of a large number of materials can be forecast differently. Thus, the ATMF system can be utilized for predicting future trends in construction material costs. Further, an out-of-sample forecast applying several material price data confirms that this system can be effectively applied to material cost estimation at a more detailed level in object-based cost planning. The proposed system can thus help decision makers in the construction industry deal with changes in economic conditions and design by estimating cost escalations caused by volatile factors such as inflation. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers."

The project includes the maintenance of river embankments, the development of river areas, and river dredging. Accordingly, considerable attention is being paid to the necessary budget and estimation of construction costs. However, only a few studies have been carried out for the cost estimation of construction projects for river development or maintenance. In particular, approximate construction cost estimations for river dredging have not been studied. The lack of sufficient studies on estimating the approximate construction cost of river dredging has caused some doubt about the validity of the project’s estimated construction cost. This study proposes a framework of an approximate cost estimating model for river dredging construction. For this purpose, the construction operation process, type of river section, and the combination of equipment employed for river dredging were analyzed from the historical data of river dredging projects conducted in South Korea. The appropriateness of the analysis was examined through interviews with experts in the field. The framework of the approximate cost estimating model for river dredging construction proposed in this study provides a basis from which to develop a more accurate construction cost estimation of river dredging at the planning stage. © 2011, Springer Verlag.

In addition to its basic role of providing shelter, the sub-sector contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product of both developing and developed countries, and plays an equally important role in the creation of employment. Unfortunately, the way building projects are managed in developing countries has often led to the under- or non-exploitation of the potential of these projects. Many factors, including inaccurate estimation techniques, poor and the challenge in predicting building construction labour cost, contribute to the poor management of building construction projects. Thus labour costing has become a key parameter for use in building construction projects. This article aims to investigate the use of an ontology-based technology in modelling information about labour costs in order to facilitate decision-making among building developers. This is achieved by pursuing two objectives. Firstly, a domain ontology that captures knowledge about labour costing practices in developing countries in general and Cameroon in particular is developed. Secondly, an ontology rule-based application is developed to facilitate decision-making and computation of labour cost in building construction projects. Three exemplary case scenarios are presented to illustrate how a construction decision-maker can intuitively query the labour cost ontology and navigate the results. © 2011 The authors."

CCI is the weighted average price of construction activities in 20 United States (US) cities. CCI has widely been used for cost estimation, bid preparation and investment planning. Cost estimators and investment planners are not only interested in the current CCI, but also are interested in forecasting changes in CCI trends. However, CCI is subject to significant variations that are difficult to predict. An important step towards forecasting CCI trends is to identify its leading indicators. The research objective is to identify the leading indicators of CCI using empirical tests. The results of Granger causality tests show that consumer price index, crude oil price, producer price index, GDP, employment levels in construction, number of building permits, number of housing starts and money supply are the leading indicators of CCI. The results of Johansen's cointegration tests show that money supply and crude oil price are the leading indicators with long-term relationships with CCI. These findings contribute to the body of knowledge in CCI forecasting. CCI can be predicted more accurately using its leading indicators. Cost estimators and capital project planners can benefit from better forecasting through reduction in uncertainty about future construction costs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Survey participants were asked questions about how BIM was used within their organization and how it was used in the various tasks involved in construction cost estimating. The results of the survey data revealed that while most contractors were using BIM, only a small minority were using it to automate estimating processes.

The integrated method is applied to range estimation of building projects. Two techniques; elimination of the input variables, and Bayesian regularization were implemented to improve generalization capabilities of the neural network models.

The results provide evidence from a specific sector and location that contributes to the accumulated evidence on the topic. Design/methodology/ approach - Stochastic frontier regression is used to measure the effect of the introduction and expansion of prevailing wage requirements on the cost efficiency of public school construction in British Columbia. The results of a likelihood ratio test indicate that stochastic frontier regression is preferred to OLS cost estimation because of the presence of statistically different cost inefficiencies across a sample of covered and uncovered projects. Findings - Specifically, projects covered by the introductory stage of the wage requirements are significantly less cost efficient compared to other public school projects. However, by the time of the expansion of the wage policy 17 months later, covered projects were no more cost inefficient than other projects. The results indicate that if prevailing wage laws are associated with changes in the cost efficiency of construction, stochastic frontier regression is the preferred estimation technique. Research limitations/implications - This is the first study of its kind with results specific to school construction in British Columbia. Further research based on data from other projects may/may not confirm the existence of differences in construction cost inefficiencies for projects covered by construction wage policies. Social implications - By implication, the results suggest that if the cost inefficiency of prevailing wage laws is short-lived, the impact on the total cost of construction may similarly be ephemeral. The results imply that prevailing wage regulations do not contribute to long-run construction cost inefficiency. Originality/value - This is the first study to use stochastic frontier regression to examine the cost inefficiencies associated with prevailing wage laws. Previous studies that examine the effect of the wage policy on construction costs are based on OLS estimation. Copyright © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved."

This is because productivity prediction and cost estimation of HDD involves a large number of objective and subjective factors that need to be considered. Therefore, the main objective of the present research is to identify and study the factors that affect productivity of HDD operations. To achieve this objective a thorough literature review is carried out and data on potential factors impacting productivity are collected from HDD experts across North America and abroad. The presented research identifies 13 factors classified under four main categories: managerial, mechanical, environmental and pipe physical conditions. The impact of these factors on HDD productivity is assessed within three types of soils: clay, rock, and sand. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique is used to quantify this impact and rank these factors according to their relative importance. Results show that pipe diameter, operator and crew skills, soil type, and steering problems have the highest impact on HDD productivity as evaluated by many experts in the field. However, pipe type, length and depth are the least impacting factors. This analysis is proved to be helpful for contractors, consultants and HDD professionals in predicting execution time and estimating cost of HDD projects during the pre-construction phase. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

In 2012 the Superintendence of Cultural Heritage of Aosta Valley - IT (Soprintendenza per i Beni e le Attività Culturali della Region e Autonoma Valle d'Aosta) carried out a complex archaeological excavation in a composite archaeological context, situated an urban background: the Aosta city centre. This archaeological excavation has been characterized by the classical urban archaeological issues: little space, short time, complex s tratigraphy. Moreover the investigations have come out several structures and walls that required safety and conservation measures. Ad hoc 3D solutions carried out a complete 3D survey of the area in 10 different time/situations of the Archaeological digs, chosen in collaborations with the archaeological staff. In this way a multi temporal 3D description of the site has been provided for the archaeo logical analysis and for the project of the restorations activities. The 3D surveys has been carried out integrating GPS, laser scanner technology and photogrammetry. In order to meet the needs of th e site, and its complex logistics and to obtain products that guarantee the high quality and detail required for archaeological analysis, we have developed different procedures and methodologies: hdr imaging for 3D model with correct, consistent and uniform colours, noise filtering and people filtering, for the removal of interference between laser instrument and object of the survey, Advanced laser scanner triangulation, in order to consider both artificial and natural tie points, for a correct registration of a huge am ount of scans.

The software platform integrates a 3D database management system. All information (measurements, plotting, areas of interests⋯) a re organized according to their correct 3D position. They can be queried using attributes, geometric characteristics or their spatial pos ition. The Ad Hoc Archaeology plug-in allows archeologists to fill out UUSS sheets in an internal database, put them in the correct locatio n within the 3D model of the site, define the mutual relations between the UUSS, divide the different archaeological phases. A simple interface will facilitate the construction of the stratigraphic chart (matrix), in a 3D environment as well (matrix 3D). The Ad Hoc Conservation plug-in permits conservators and restorers to create relationships between the different approaches and des criptions of the same parts of the monument, i.e.: between stratigraphyc units or historical phases and architectural components and/o r decay pathologies. The 3D DBMS conservation module uses a codified terminology based on ""ICOMOS illustrated glossary of ston e deterioration"" and other glossary.

Though currently much work has been down to predict cost and performance of cloud applications, most of them perform either before application design or after the application construction, which leads to either imprecise estimation or irreparable design fault. In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate the cost of running typical applications in Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud during design phase. We propose an UML Activity-extended model (AeModel) to describe execution of application service and introduce an extraction algorithm to extract information contained in the AeModel automatically. We propose a cost model on AWS, which can help developers to estimate operating cost during design phase and satisfy performance needs, with an algorithm to produce suitable purchase solutions automatically. We perform case studies using a web-based business application to show effectiveness of our approach, and find that our approach can help developers lessen cost by adjusting application models. © 2012 IEEE."

Numerous decisions throughout the phases of planning and construction, as well as during the project's service life, are firmly related to efforts to prevent, mitigate or address possible adverse events. The twofold requirement to quantify subjective perceptions of risk and to elabourate the resulting data in a mathematically consistent fashion may prove to be extremely demanding. The primary aim of the present study is the representation of risk factors as individual cost elements, along with a computational setup wherein these elements can be effectively combined in order to yield reliable total cost estimates. Emphasis is drawn on quantitative decision-making under conditions of high uncertainty, complexity and partial information. The total cost is not viewed as a mere sum of fixed and independent values, but rather as the outcome of a stochastic framework, where risk dependencies are also considered. The conceptual model is inspired from the risk analysis of the Brenner Base Tunnel, one of the most important construction projects nowadays in Europe."

A number of different equipment is available for loading operations. Project managers should consider different technical and economic issues at the feasibility study stage and try to select the optimum type and size of equipment fleet, regarding the production needs and project specifications. The backhoe shovel is very popular for digging, loading and flattening tasks. Adequate cost estimation is one of the most critical tasks in feasibility studies of equipment fleet selection. This paper presents two different cost models for the preliminary and detailed feasibility study stages. These models estimate the capital and operating cost of backhoe shovels using uni-variable exponential regression (UVER) as well as multi-variable linear regression (MVLR), based on principal component analysis. The UVER cost model is suitable for quick cost estimation at the early stages of project evaluation, while the MVLR cost function, which is more detailed, can be useful for the feasibility study stage. Independent variables of MVLR include bucket size, digging depth, dump height, weight and power. Model evaluations show that these functions could be a credible tool for cost estimations in prefeasibility and feasibility studies of mining and construction projects. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika."

Bioethanol accounts for the majority of biofuel use worldwide, either as a fuel or a gasoline enhancer. Utilization of bioethanol can significantly reduce petroleum use and exhaust greenhouse gas emission. The production of this fuel has been increasing over the years, and has reached the level of 73.9 billion liters during the year 2009. Even though for decades ethanol production mainly depended on energy crops containing starch and sugar (corn, sugar cane etc.), new technologies for converting lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol are under development today. The use of lignocellulosic biomass, such as agricultural residues, forest and municipial waste, for the production of biofuels will be unavoidable if liquid fossil fuels are to be replaced by renewable and sustainable alternatives. For biological conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, pretreatment plays a central role affecting all unit operations in the process and is also an important cost deterrent to the comercial viability of the process. The key obstacles are: pretreatment selection and optimization; decreasing the cost of the enzymatic hydrolysis; maximizing the conversion of sugars (including pentoses) to ethanol; process scale-up and integration to minimize energy and water demand; characterization and evaluation of the lignin co-product; and lastly, the use of the representative and reliable data for cost estimation, and the determination of environmental and socio-economic impacts. Currently, not all pretreatments are capable of producing biomass that can be converted to sugars in high enough yield and concentration, while being economically viable. For the three main types of feedstocks, the developement of effective continuous fermentation technologies with near to 100% yields and elevated volumetric productivities is one of the main research subjects in the ethanol industry. The application of new, engineered enzyme systems for cellulose hydrolysis, the construction of inhibitor tolerant pentose fermenting strains, combined with optimized process integration promise significant improvements."

The overall results of the survey are presented and the results are further broken down by small, medium and large contractors based on the annual revenue of the company. The results revealed that most contractors are using BIM for collision detection and visualization purposes. The results also reveal that those contractors do not necessarily have personnel with expertise in BIM and construction cost estimation that can oversee the integration of BIM with estimating.

The simulation engine evaluates the performance (fitness) of each equipment combination and the genetic algorithm searches for an optimal equipment configuration while considering a set of qualitative and quantitative decision variables which influence the performance of earthmoving operations. A prototype has been developed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. Pilot simulation runs show that this system can effectively locate a near optimal equipment combination for earthmoving operations. The proposed simulation optimization framework can hence serve as an efficient tool for project management in fleet selection."

Aims: Towards this direction, we present StatREC, a Graphical User Interface, which facilitates the visualization and hypothesis testing of error distributions through their graphical representation as REC curves. Conclusions: The advantage of StatREC is that it provides to the non-expert user a robust, highly interactive, rich in graphics and easily interpretable way to perform comparisons among alternative models.

The accuracy of the budget allocated in the planning phase of such projects is considered a key element in efficient budget use, but lack of information during the planning phase results in the inaccurate estimation of the construction cost. Thus, it is necessary to devise a method that improves the accuracy of construction cost estimation in the planning phase. Although recently there has been an increase in the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) for construction cost estimation, the use of CBR tends to reduce the accuracy of the estimated construction cost, unless there is sufficient similarity between the cases stored in the database and the retrieved cases. Therefore, a revised CBR model based on the regression analysis model was developed in this study, and a calculation model capable of estimating the construction cost in the planning phase was developed with a focus on railroad-bridge construction projects. To verify the revised CBR model, five case studies were conducted. The results showed that the revised CBR model reduced the construction cost error rate of the proposed CBR model by 16.2%. In particular, it is expected that the revised CBR model will be useful when there is a lack of similarity between the cases stored in the database and the retrieved cases. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers."

However, as no past situation is ever exactly the same as a new one, old solutions should be fitted for new circumstances, which is called case adaptation. Thus, the success of CBR depends on the ability of case adaptation. Generally, the case adaptation method can be categorized by two methods: decreasing the need for adaptation and increasing the capability. Nevertheless, previous research has focused on applying the method itself and rarely examined the adaptation or candidates selection. As an effort to enhance the performance of CBR, this research develops a case adaptation method that is balanced for both methods. To validate the method, a CBR cost model was developed that has an adaptation function using 129 military barrack projects in Korea, and then the method was tested by using 13 test cases.

To reduce this financial risk, it is crucial to accurately estimate the schematic construction cost of such projects. However, traditional cost estimating practices (TCEP) are not effective at predicting the cost of schematic design phase design alternatives that involve the change in the number of building stories. To address these issues, this research proposes a schematic cost estimating model (SCEM). The SCEM estimates the schematic construction cost of super tall building alternatives using a simulation mechanism that considers variation in the number of building stories (i.e., ±5, ±10, ±15, ±20 stories). First, the limitations of the traditional practices are identified. Then, three pilot alternatives (i.e., one schematic design and two design alternatives) are designed and estimated in detail. Next, cost simulation mechanism is constructed based on the relationships between design scale, material quantity, unit cost rate, and construction cost. In addition, after determining which dominant factors affect construction cost when the number of building stories changes, the high-rise premium ratio and its theoretical framework are introduced. This ratio is used to identify the productivity ratios of super tall buildings and to simulate construction cost as the building design changes. Finally, the SCEM is validated through a case study of an actual super tall building. It is found that schematic construction cost increases as the unit cost rate rises due to a low productivity ratio in the case of a higher number of building stories. Conversely, this cost decreases as the unit cost rate goes down due to a high productivity ratio in the case of a lower number of building stories. Ultimately, the SCEM is developed to support effective decision-making during the schematic design phase."

These risks are calculated by using stochastic approaches. Possible bid sums are estimated by applying Monte Carlo simulations.

The developed model, called FALCON-COST, integrates the component ratios method, fuzzy adaptive learning control network (FALCON), fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), and three-point cost estimation method to systematically deal with a cost-estimating environment involving limited and uncertain data. In addition, the proposed model improves the current FALCON by devising a new algorithm to conduct building block selection and random gene deletion so that fmGA operations can be implemented in FALCON. The results of 54 case studies demonstrate that the proposed model has estimation accuracy of 83.82%, meaning it is approximately 22.74%, 23.08%, and 21.95% more accurate than the conventional average cost method, component ratios method, and modified FALCON-COST method, respectively.

This is being realized by quantifying the external cost related with the climate change airborne emissions (i.e. carbon dioxide) generated during all stages of the power plants life cycle in Greece. For this purpose, the paper applies the EcoSenseLE tool, together with the basic principles of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The examined external cost has been calculated for seven types of power plants. Results show that hydro and wind power plants have an excellent performance; close to them is the performance of PV and biomass-fired power plants. The performance of natural gas-fired power plants is good, while the performance of oil-fired power plants is, as it is expected poor. Lignite clearly has the worst performance, which affects the average external cost of the sector, since it is the dominant energy source in electricity production in Greece. Regarding the life cycle stages, for thermal systems, the climate change external cost is primarily made of CO2 emitted at the power plant, while in hydro, wind and PV systems, it is totally associated with the plant construction stage. Moreover, the paper includes also issues regarding the evolution of the examined footprint within the next years, considering the various Greek national policies and measures that have been announced and started to be realized; the cost/benefit analysis (CBA) of these policies and measures based on this footprint; and the investigation if this CBA is being affected by the CO 2 abatement cost associated with the various external cost estimation approaches. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A system assisting in the early cost estimation of road tunnels would therefore be of great value as it would allow the quick costing of alternative and more economical solutions. The development of such an early cost estimation system is discussed in this paper. First, the basic parameters (geological, geometrical, and work quantities-related) affecting temporary and permanent support and final construction cost are determined. After that, appropriate real-world data derived from the analysis of 33 twin tunnels of 46km total length constructed for the Egnatia Motorway in northern Greece from 1998 to 2004 and related to work quantities is collected and normalized. Appropriate price lists are then applied to calculate the costs; subsequently, cost-estimating models are developed using two types of neural networks: (1)the multilayer feed-forward network; and (2)the general regression neural network.

The aim of this paper is to identify, evaluate and rank essential factors affecting the accuracy of pre-tender cost estimating from the perspective of clients and consultants. A survey questionnaire was conducted to elicit professionals' views on and experiences with factors affecting the accuracy of pre-tender cost estimates; a total of 70 organisations (i.e., 46 clients and 24 consultants operating in the Gaza Strip, Palestine) responded to the survey. The results of analysing a total of 64 factors considered in the questionnaire reveal that the top five factors affecting the accuracy of pre-tender cost estimating are (1) materials (prices/availability/supply/quality/imports), (2) closure and blockade of borders, (3) project team's experience in the construction type, (4) the experience and skill level of the consultant and (5)clear and detailed drawings and specifications. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used as a measure of agreement between the two groups of respondents (i.e., clients and consultants)who ranked various factors and it appears that they are generally in agreement. Both clients and consultant groups should focus on the main factors identified in this study to develop effective strategies for accurate cost estimating, which would ultimately lead to successful projects. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013."

The estimator has to be able to make judgement on the cost influence of a number of factors including site conditions, procurement, risks, price changes, likely scope changes or type of contract. This can shroud the estimation process in uncertainty, which has often resulted in project cost overruns. The knowledge acquisition, generalisation and forecasting capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are explored in this pilot study to build final cost estimation models that incorporate the cost effect of some of the factors mentioned above. Data was collected on ninety-eight water-related construction projects completed in Scotland between 2007-2011. Separate cost models were developed for normalised target cost and log of target costs. Variable transformation and weight decay regularisation were then explored to improve the final model's performance. As a prototype of a wider research, the final model's performance was very satisfactory, demonstrating ANN ability to capture the interactions between the predictor variables and final cost. Ten input variables, all readily available or measurable at the planning stages for the project, were used within a Multilayer Perceptron Architecture and a Quasi-Newton training algorithm."

In order to update and improve its structure and figures, 15 construction sites and 5 steel fabrication shops were visited over a period of two years. From the study, it was found that the structure of Poom-Sam was rather complex and outdated and that the average SP of the works analyzed from the research was approximately 85% of the current SP. Moreover, the effect of the productivity differences on total construction cost was approximately 10%.

The question arises whether all of these components are important from the effort estimation point of view. Objective: This paper investigates the construction of UCP in order to find possible ways of simplifying it. Method: The cross-validation procedure was used to compare the accuracy of the different variants of UCP (with and without the investigated simplifications). The analysis was based on data derived from a set of 14 projects for which effort ranged from 277 to 3593 man-hours. In addition, the factor analysis was performed to investigate the possibility of reducing the number of adjustment factors. Results: The two variants of UCP - with and without unadjusted actor weights (UAW) provided similar prediction accuracy. In addition, a minor influence of the adjustment factors on the accuracy of UCP was observed. The results of the factor analysis indicated that the number of adjustment factors could be reduced from 21 to 6 (2 environmental factors and 4 technical complexity factors). Another observation was made that the variants of UCP calculated based on steps were slightly more accurate than the variants calculated based on transactions. Finally, a recently proposed use-case-based size metric TTPoints provided better accuracy than any of the investigated variants of UCP. Conclusion: The observation in this study was that the UCP method could be simplified by rejecting UAW; calculating UCP based on steps instead of transactions; or just counting the total number of steps in use cases. Moreover, two recently proposed use-case-based size metrics Transactions and TTPoints could be used as an alternative to UCP to estimate effort at the early stages of software development. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore the special method needs to improve the accuracy of estimating construction cost in the planning phase. Recently, to improve the accuracy of estimating construction cost for road bridges and architectural facilities, Case-based Reasoning (CBR) which makes use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) and other principles are being used. This study suggests the cost estimation model which uses CBR and makes the database reflected the character of the railroad bridge. To establish this effective CBR model, this study examined combinations of attributes, criteria of similarities and retrieval ranks and applied GA for an optimization of attribute weights throughout learning process. According to the results of this study, CBR should use a five-attribute combination, retrieve six similar cases and use the similarity criteria by applying a method in which ten points are deducted for each 10% difference to get the minimum error. According to the verification results of the CBR model, the mean absolute error rate is 11. 9% and the standard deviation is 12. 7%. Therefore, the accuracy of this CBR model is 30% more effective than the criteria of Ministry of Construction & Transportation (MOCT) and Korea Development Institute (KDI) model. © 2011 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Accordingly, estimating construction costs must consider the trend of costs in the market, where construction costs normally change over time. Insight into the trend of construction costs in the market, therefore, is beneficial, even critical, to the effective cost management of construction projects. In an effort to support such insight development, two time series models were built by analyzing time series index data and comparing them with existing methods in the present study. The developed time series models accurately predict construction cost indexes. In particular, the models respond sensitively and swiftly to a quick, large change of costs, which allows for accurate forecasting over the short- and long-term periods.

Past studies of highway project duration and cost estimation were focused on construction, and few studies have focused on preconstruction project delivery from an agency's perspective. This paper proposes the use of hazard-based duration models for investigating the potential risk factors that could affect project development time from planning to letting. A database containing over 35 years of highway project data from the state of Indiana was used to develop appropriate models. Of the three model forms (Weibull, Weibull with gamma heterogeneity, and log-logistic) considered in the paper, it was found that the log-logistic model is the most appropriate for modeling project development time. For each work category (pavement, bridge, and road/ interchange projects), risk factors were identified, and their influences on project development time (and consequently, on letting time) were investigated. The developed hazard-based duration models were further applied to demonstrate their ability to predict expected project development time for delivery and the project-related factors that influence this duration, thereby providing the agency with a useful interpretation of associated delivery risks. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Since various risk-factors affect the construction costs, the actual costs generally deviate from the estimated costs in a favourable or an adverse direction. Therefore, not only estimation of the costs but also an analysis of the uncertainty of the estimated costs is required. This requirement gains more importance in projects constrained by money as the main driver. The traditional cost estimation, i.e. predicting the construction costs and simply calculating the total, is deterministic and insufficient. This approach neglects the uncertainty and the correlation effects. A new simulation-based model-the correlated cost risk analysis model (CCRAM)-is proposed to analyse the construction costs under uncertainty when the costs and risk-factors are correlated. CCRAM captures the correlation between the costs and risk-factors indirectly and qualitatively.

CE's air-contactor design is based on the wet-scrubbing method, where air is brought into contact with an alkali hydroxide CO 2-absorbing liquid solution. This is a similar process to that carried out in absorption or reactor towers commonly used in the chemical processing industry, but unique constraints posed by the challenge of removing CO2 from atmospheric air have led CE to a number of original, innovative, and proprietary design modifications to these existing technologies. These key differences have led CE to depart from traditional chemical industry practice involving packed reactor towers, and to develop an intermittently- wetted air-contactor with cross-flow slab geometry. This design has as much in common with induced draft cooling towers as with chemical reactor towers. Design has been tested in a 5m tall packed tower prototype and detailed tests of packing performance have been performed in a laboratory system that enables us to control CO2, air velocity, relative humidity while accurately measuring packing performance. In addition to CE's on-going in-house engineering and experimental evaluations, the structural design and cost estimation of the air-contactor system was performed by an independent Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm (SolTech Projects Inc., Calgary, Alberta). The cost estimate produced by this EPC firm forms a conservative upper bound on the cost of the air-contactor because it is based on 2008/09 Alberta, Canada construction and labour costs, which were among the highest in the world. The EPC firm collected quotes from vendors for major equipment and components, and the total system cost was estimated using standard engineering cost-evaluation procedures. The total estimated cost of the air-contacting system, evaluated using conservative labour and energy rates as mention equates to $80/tonne- CO2 and CE has identified specific areas of research to decrease this cost to $49/tonne-CO2. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

This can be attributed to a lack of competitive steel construction products combined with a strong presence of precast fabricators in the region. For steel girders there is a lack of readily available economical and innovative procedures to design and construct steel bridges, which has hindered the industry in certain areas of the country such as Colorado. A significant percent of the bridges throughout the United States are in need of repair and many in need of replacement. In many part of the country, steel bridges can provide an economic and rapid solution for new and replacement bridges. This paper summarizes the results of a study sponsored by the Colorado DOT to develop a rapid preliminary design and cost estimation tool for simple-made-continuous design and construction. In that method, steel girders are designed as simply supported for the noncomposite dead loads and continuous for composite dead loads and live loads, which can provide economy for spans up to 35 m (120 ft). The methodology summarized herein follows the logic of the AASHTO LRFD specifications.

From a sensitivity analysis of those materials' prices on the overall disposal costs, it was found that Cu powder was a more dominant cost driver than that of bentonite among the material costs to dispose of 52,000 tU of spent fuels by the deterministic cost estimation method even though the used volume of Cu powder will be smaller than that of bentonite, whereas those conclusions can be changed by a probabilistic cost estimation method. Namely, its conclusion depends on a decision maker's personal opinion because of the resultant uncertainties. The disposal cost includes too many uncertainties due to the long construction and operational durations of a repository. Therefore a probabilistic cost estimation can be useful to provide the information related to an uncertainty. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This study compared log-normal and Gamma regressions for effort estimation in terms of their predictive performance. Both regressions were examined with multiple datasets and two formulation approaches. As a result, it was found that log-normal and Gamma regressions have contrasting characteristics though the difference is diminished when uncertainty of effort is well explained by predictor variables.

Yet, little is known about the accuracy of RBE and its performance drivers. A comparison of water projects using RBE with a sample of construction projects using the conventional estimating approach shows that the projects estimated using RBE have better estimation accuracy than those estimated using more conventional approaches. In addition, the projects using RBE appear more likely to be under-budget while the ones using the conventional approach appear more likely to be over-budget. Further, through interviews and observations of the RBE process, three main performance drivers for the RBE method were identified to include outside view/collective experience, attention focusing and probabilistic, bottom-up modelling. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

A 1-year prospective four-arm controlled randomized community-based clinical trial. Participants were people ages 60 years or older residing in community settings who were medically diagnosed with either hypertension or hyperlipidemia. They were recruited through a number of venues beginning in May 2003. The 321 eligible individuals were assigned to one of four arms: (a) a literature control group, (b) a therapeutic meal group that received seven diagnosis-appropriate therapeutic meals a week, (c) an MNT group, and (d) an MNT-plus-therapeutic meal group. The outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included both intervention and medical costs. Estimations of separate models of costs and QALYs facilitated the construction of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Net benefit analysis produced the probability that each intervention was cost-effective given different values for society's willingness to pay for a QALY. Therapeutic meals are cost-effective. Using the net benefit approach and a willingness to pay of $109,000 per QALY, the probability that the therapeutic meal delivery program is cost-effective is 95% and for MNT the probability is 90%. However, the combination of MNT and therapeutic meals did not have an independent significant effect on QALYs.

This paper investigates the estimation of highway project duration on the basis of variables known at the planning phase such as planned cost and project type, and contract type. Project types are pavement construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, traffic facility installation, and bridge construction. The contract types considered are fixed-duration and fixed-deadline contracts. Using a variety of model specifications, the paper presents mathematical relationships between highway project duration and the magnitude of the planned cost and project type, and contract type. The paper shows that all other factors remaining the same, the duration of fixed-date deadline contracts generally exceed that of fixed-duration contracts; and higher levels of planned cost translate non-linearly into greater project duration. The developed models can help project administrators provide improved estimates of project duration and thus could help reduce project time delays.

The schema identifies the E&S impacts associated with each project element, lists possible impacted entities, provides access and description to existing methods to estimate associated E&S costs, and provides links to best practices to mitigate such impacts. The schema was encoded into an extensible markup language. The schema was developed based on a synthesis of the different ways for cost estimation, cost estimates, and best practices for managing the E&S costs of highway construction. The schema was evaluated through interviews with domain experts and through analysis of three representative case studies. An interactive Web site was developed to support project teams establish a unified view of the costs, their estimates, and best practices to control them. © 2009 ASCE."

The scenarios were evaluated from some of the development targets and design goals in the FaCT project. The isotopic compositions of the nuclear fuels and wastes and the quantities of radioactive wastes (HLWs, LLWs) from Japanese nuclear fuel cycle facilities were calculated to grasp the sustainability characteristics. Regarding the long-term economics, the total cash out-flows and the average electricity generation costs to 22nd century were calculated. Cash out-flow peaks and waste generation peaks were found from 2030s to 2050s, 2090s to 2110s, and 2150s to 2170s because of the cost and wastes from decommissioning of the nuclear power plants and reprocessing plants for LWR spent fuel and the construction costs of them. Firstly, the major results of the reference case are explained combined with introduction of the function of the dynamic analysis tool (Supply Chain Management Code). The analysis is related to sustainability and economics in FaCT project development targets since they are important in the sustainability and economics evaluation. Secondly, the comparisons between the reference case and the three other option cases with their own issues of choice are explained. Those options are different breeding ratios, dual-purpose reprocessing plant, and Am-Cm recycling. As the tentative conclusions of the analyses are: the exploration of the optimal breeding ratio between B.R. =1.1 and 1.2 at the start up stage of FR is regarded as reasonable; the cost reduction of the dual purpose reprocessing plant resulted from the facility integration was confirmed though the cost estimation of the facility should be modified, it is a little bit too hasty to decide the manner of MA recycling because many issues to be considered are left at present although some of the effect on electricity generation cost and HLW generation were calculated. More accurate analyses with this tool for further investigation especially for the latter two comparisons are expected."

Although this approach is widely accepted, its validity has not been substantiated. The study uses geographic information system (GIS) tools to conduct spatial and statistical analyses and confirm the validity of the ""nearest available"" method. An assessment of alternative interpolation methods was also conducted, including an evaluation of the state average and the nearest available value within state boundary. The study determined that the nearest available within state boundary method produced the least amount of error between actual and estimated values and therefore, should produce the most accurate location adjustment estimate between the three methods evaluated."

GIS use is also explored for construction quantity takeoffs and cost estimation. The purpose of this paper is to supplement the already explored capabilities of GIS in construction by providing the methodology for direct sunlight visualisation on buildings. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed methodology for direct sunlight visualisation is to calculate the solar angles and use them for spatial distribution representation of the amount of sunlight received on different faces of a building by rendering it with the colour of varied gradients. The colour gradient on any face of a building depends upon the amount of direct sunlight received. The solar gain is demonstrated through the multi-dimensional data visualisation like sun angle variations with diurnal and annual cycles in a navigable 3D animation. Findings – GIS-based methodology provides the planner a way to control the natural lighting and solar gain on a building which can be combined with the project schedule, quantity takeoffs, cost estimate and 4D visualisation in a single environment. Beginning with this idea, the planner may store and share information about a construction project, site and surrounding geography. Originality/value – Most of the existing 4D CAD technologies do not have project management capabilities and are used mainly for the planning and design stage of a construction project. In comparison, GIS-based tools may be used in different stages. These are more management-based and allow more collaborative and cooperative relationships between designer, constructor and client. By using a GIS-based approach, construction documents like schedules, drawings, quantity takeoffs, cost estimates, project specifications and direct sunlight visualisations are more consistent with each other. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited"

Among the desalination technologies, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process becomes increasingly attractive for freshwater supply with comparatively low energy consumption and cost-effective operation. In this study, a benchmark of operating Fujairah SWRO desalination plant in the United Arab Emirates is applied to assess the relative performance of a new and large plant construction in other sites. A process model was developed to simulate the performance of SWRO desalination process and to estimate its operating cost. The developed model was validated using one-year SWRO operation data obtained from Fujairah SWRO desalination plant. Temperature and salinity data were collected from World Ocean Atlas 2005, and then applied to the model to estimate the operating cost under the site-specific conditions of 9 different countries. The results of this study present that the performance of the SWRO desalination process was significantly influenced by feed water concentration (i.e., mainly salinity) and temperature, and that the total operating cost is significantly dependent of the local electricity costs. As a conclusion, World Ocean Atlas data and the benchmark provide a method of comparing the performance of various SWRO desalination systems among different countries.

The first step was to generate the Andalusia construction information classification system (ACICS). Not only is ACICS valid as an estimation of cost, but it also provides a common method to manage information during the design and construction of buildings. Another important innovation is that this BCS defines the cost structure which distinguishes between direct and indirect cost and thereby allows a clear definition of all costs for each project type. Its most extended usage is for estimating cost in building projects and it is mandatory in public developments in Andalusia. This is the first time that this system is presented internationally and compared to others. Furthermore, the latest additions to ACICS are explained, and these take into account the waste management of reused and recycled materials in the budget estimate through a new division in the classification: Waste Management. Finally, a new way to address the cost related to construction and demolition waste management is explained which increases precision and generates an estimate independent from the general budget. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."

Through the automation of construction drawings, not only can these matters be enhanced, but better quality control can be obtained and a reduction can be achieved in the time spent on building design. The introduction of parametric modeling tools, a concept well known as Building Information Modeling (BIM), allows end users to input rich information to CAD models. At this point in time, however, not every BIM platform provides the ability to automate specific design tasks for construction. As a result, the introduction and further usage of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in CAD environments has produced interesting results when specific tasks are mimicked. This research centers its attention on the development of GAs for building design for those specific design tasks which are unavailable in current BIM packages. This research demonstrates its extensibility through the automation of construction drawings of drywall layout for wood stick-frame dwellings. Previous research in this area has proven the benefits of automating building designs for wood framing by minimizing material waste and improving its usage. Today, the need to become lean and environmentally friendly is one of the targets many construction companies are seeking. With the development of GAs in CAD environments, decision makers in residential construction can benefit by improving their current practice and obtaining better control over specific tasks. This research has developed a methodology based on the i3 (icube) concept - a combination of intelligence, innovation and information.to help designers and constructors enhance their practice. This paper also presents the application of a knowledge-based system for quantity take-off and cost estimation. In order to minimize material waste from the design end, this research has focused on the utilization of mathematical algorithms for twodimensional materials based on the cutting stock problem."

Ant colony algorithms are a subset of swarm intelligence and consider the ability of simple ants to solve complex problems by cooperation. The proposed approach has been successfully used to optimize the path generation, cost estimation and road construction problem in 3D real world search space and has captured successfully the essence of the 3D problem structure. This paper presents an application of 2D-3D-CACA to solve the pipe distribution network optimization problem. To be clear, all previous attempts have been focused on discrete nature of pipe distribution network, where network elements positions are fixed and known in prior. This paper provides an initial study for the use of 2D-3DCACA in solving pipe distribution network problems in 3D continuous search spaces. Herein, the positions of network elements are not known in advance, except some initial starting points. The optimization of pipe distribution networks designs are complex, multi-modal problems that cannot be easily solved with conventional optimization algorithms. The problem is formulated as a constrained multiple-objective optimization problem. One example of Pipe network optimization is internal water distribution network design (WDND) optimization. Water distribution network design (WDNDs) is costly infrastructure, and much attention has been given to the application of optimization methods to minimize design costs. Herein, the application of the 2D-3D-CACA to water network design optimization is considered. In this paper, a mathematical formulation is developed which enables 2D-3D-CACA to be used for the optimal design of WDN and thus to obtain the least cost design of the network. The 2D-3D-CACA has been used to determine the minimum cost of the water network system taking into consideration some design criteria (pipes lengths, no. of rounds,....). Although, the paper presents an initial study and investigation of the possibilities offered by 2D-3D-CACA to optimize pipe distribution network design, preliminary simulation results on three 3D artificial models show that the proposed evolutionary optimization algorithm is efficient and suitable for any generalized pipe distribution network design in 3D continuous search space."

Previous studies applied scoring methods and established common rules or mathematical methods to assess the quality of cost estimates. However, those approaches have some limitations in adapting to real-world projects or require understanding of sophisticated statistical techniques. We propose a Conceptual Cost Estimate Reliability Index (CCERI), a simple, easy-to-use, and easy-to-understand tool that incorporates weights for 20 factors influencing the quality of conceptual cost estimates. The weights were obtained by eliciting experts' experience and knowledge. Cost data from 71 building projects were used in the analysis and validation of the CCERI. The analysis reveals that a conceptual cost estimate with a CCERI score of less than 3000 has a high probability of exceeding 10% error, and such conceptual cost estimates are unlikely to be reliable. With the CCERI score, a decision maker or a client can recognize the reliability of the conceptual cost estimates and the score can thus support decision making using conceptual cost estimates. In addition, with the CCERI and the relative importance weights of factors affecting the conceptual cost estimates, the estimator can find ways to modify a conceptual cost estimate and reestimate it. These alternatives can decrease the risk in the conceptual estimated cost and assist in the successful management of a construction project."

In this paper, a generic method based on network topology design, called ""the spider network topology"" is proposed to achieve link cost reduction between distinct nodes communications in the modern ad-hoc networks. In our approach, the link cost reduction using the spider topology is compared with the complete graph topology [1] for ad-hoc networks (link is thought as the system resource for cost estimation in the following sections). Our contribution is concentrated on less total link cost as compared with the complete graph construction under the constraint that average connection links between distinct nodes is less than some constant. The spider network topology technique adopted in this paper is superior than other network topology in some conditions, especially when there are no clear relationship between node pairs for link constructions. The spider network behaves the advantage both in easy implementation and less congestion occurring. This characteristic will benefit on the system performance improving, especially in reliability guarantees. The new architecture presented here can be widely applied in topology design for the modern ad-hoc networks due to the efficient link constructions. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

The correlations between cost related variables and total construction cost and plant construction cost were obtained based on 26 collected data sets of design flow rate, influent BOD5 concentration and cost data etc. The study revealed that the proposed NN outperformed linear regression in respect to performance measures such as mean absolute error rate and coefficient of determination.

Therefore, an accurate estimation of the risks associated with the warranty is a significant cost issue for any contractor to cover potential risks while still being competitive in bidding. Quantitative evaluation of the cost of risk incurred by the warranty has several difficulties.

Aim: This paper aims to explain why this approach to model comparison is often invalid and to suggest that the PROMISE repository may be making things worse. Method: We identify some of the theoretical problems with studies that compare different estimation models. We review some of the commonly used datasets from the viewpoint of the reliability of the data and the validity of the proposed linear regression models. Discussion points: It is invalid to select one or two datasets to ""prove"" the validity of a new technique because we cannot be sure that, of the many published datasets, those chosen are the only ones that favour the new technique. When new models are compared with regression models, researchers need to understand how to use regression analysis appropriately. The use of linear regression presupposes: a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, no significant outliers, no significant skewness, no relationship between the variance of the dependent variable and the magnitude of the variable. If all these conditions are not true, standard statistical practice is to use a robust regression or transform the data. The logarithmic transformation is appropriate in many cases, and for the Desharnais dataset gives better results than the regression model presented in the PROMISE repository. Conclusions: Simplistic studies comparing data intensive methods with linear regression will be scientifically valueless, if the regression techniques are applied incorrectly. They are also suspect if only a small number of datasets are used and the selection of those datasets is not scientifically justified. © ACM 2009."

Also wider scale building portfolios are requested as conceptual extensions to VBE and BIM. This study is based on ongoing PhD studies on building information modelling and environmental life cycle assessment."

It has been concluded that it is important to make a clear distinction between normal cost and time, and the risk events that cause exceptional cost and time. The budget and tender price can be determined separately, both by the client and contractor respectively. To meet the demands placed on decision making for tender and procurement for currently favored construction- contracting methods, a new model for estimating tender price and budget has been developed, and is described in this paper. The predictions obtained from the estimation model are shown to be realistic, as the total construction cost and time obtained from the model correspond fairly well to the actual construction cost and time. The separate estimation of normal cost and time and exceptional cost and time contribute to the clarity of the results. © 2010 IEEE."

Uncertainties in the future cost of energy (e.g., electricity price) and financing (e.g., interest and inflation rates) were represented by probability distributions, and correlations among these variable parameters (i.e., statistical dependence between two or more variables) were estimated based on past records. The stochastic cost model was further coupled with a process simulation model that predicts performance measures such as water production rate and produced water quality. The coupled model was applied to a case study in which a virtual full-scale SWRO plant is constructed using two configuration options: single-stage single-pass (SSSP) and double-stage single-pass (DSSP). The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the coupled model in ranking and comparing a large number of design and operating conditions for the full-scale SWRO plant. The main criteria for comparison were (1) the ability to meet the required production rate and water quality standards, such as salt and boron rejection rates, and (2) the unit cost of water production. The results show that cost estimates and relative rankings of various design and operating conditions from the stochastic approach are often different than those determined by the deterministic approach. More importantly, the stochastic model allows the decision maker to quantitatively consider the uncertainties in the cost estimates for this energy-intensive technology. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

In Australia architects are the primary designers of buildings. Yet, in the Australian context very little work has examined how architects view cost estimation in order to understand cost dynamics. A first step in ascertaining the key issues in relation to cost estimation and design is when architects engage a Quantity Surveyor. The aim is to examine the costing of the conceptual design of projects rather than focusing on professional roles between architect and QS. The point at which a QS is appointed in the design process is identified. The types of issues that arise in relation to costing and design are recognized. To do this, 1132 architects were approached and 85 surveys were received. Each respondent was asked to answer questions related to the highest value project completed by their office. The types of design issues that were acknowledged were related to finishes, construction methods and materials. Of concern was the ability of the QS to cost accurately in situations that required expert knowledge related to a location or particular building type. The results are a first step in formulating further research investigating the ongoing cost messages and costing iterations that take place during the project delivery process. Understanding this dynamic in the first instance will aid research into value management, project benchmarking studies, bidding and tendering as well as stakeholder management studies."

These early estimates are commonly prepared through the aid of historical data and later adjusted to take into account specific project characteristics such as location. The common practice for adjusting estimates for location is to use sets of location cost factors. When a location is not represented in the chosen data set, the nearest location factor is usually selected. The validity of this interpolation method has not been substantiated. Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques are used to conduct spatial analysis of the RSMeans' City Cost Index (CCI) national reference data. Spatial auto-correlation of these CCI values is tested to determine the validity of the nearest neighbor interpolation method at both the national and state level. In addition, an alternative analysis between nearest neighbor and the state average CCI value methods has been performed. Findings reveal positive, nationwide correlation between proximity and CCI values. In addition, 19 individual states showed highly significant results of positive correlation between proximity and CCI value and no state showed significant negative correlation. The alternative analysis between nearest neighbor and state average was not conclusive. Half the time the nearest neighbor measure provided a better estimate, and half the time the state averageproved a better measure. © ASCE 2009."

Nonetheless, there are some doubts regarding the cost of future installations, also considering the delays in which some Gen-III PWRs incurred. Analyzing available data on capital cost, the major plant's life-cycle-cost component, this paper firstly shows that the Three Miles Island accident really represented a bad turnaround, since after that the uncertainty related to the capital cost has dramatically grown: several plants have continued to being built quickly and with costs comparable to the past, others performed (economically) very poorly, mainly due to the high delays for their construction that even took decades. This uncertainty reflects today to the cost estimation of new nuclear units, and consequently to the capital cost of Small Medium Reactors, the Gen-lV Nuclear Power Plants of the mid-term future. The paper deals with this topic, trying to model the uncertainty currently affecting capital cost estimation of past reactors and evaluates its impact on the competitiveness assessment of new NPPs. Several scenarios involving Small Medium Reactors have been tested, in comparison with the Large Reactor option by means of the INCAS model. Reasonable values and distributions have been assumed from literature for all the needed parameters and the electricity wholesale prices. The competitiveness of Small Medium Reactors have been evaluated with a Monte Carlo method using the following economical competitiveness indexes: Net Present Value, financial exposure, project balance, leverage. Final results show that, under certain assumptions, Small Medium Reactors prove to be competitive, not only considering the smoother project balance and shorter leverage, even with an inferior Net Present Value, but especially the uncertainty reduction of these financial indicators."

This decouples the designer from the process of the cost estimation and makes produced estimates difficult to analyze. While the process of the cost estimation for rigid buildings is a fairly complex task, it is even more complicated for non-rigid, flexible, ""form-active"" structures. The flexible nature induces - at least theoretically - an unlimited number of possible geometries. This form variety in turn introduces a non-linearity when it comes to face the cost factors. Slight adjustments and modifications done by the designer may often influence the total costs significantly. In such cases a static analysis of the model may be insufficient and more data may be required to cover ""hidden"" cost factors properly. The obvious shortcomings and drawbacks of the traditional ways motivated us for the development of a new approach for assisting architects to obtain accurate cost estimates. Driven by the wish to improve ""architectural quality"" - by giving more and new ways to the designer to understand what he/she is doing and how it influences the entire project - we developed an interactive tool that is to be integrated into the existing design software for form-active structures such as ""Formfinder"". This paper presents a description of our tool and shows how accurate estimates can be obtained by following a new non-classic approach. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London."

Particularly in quantity take-off and estimation, BIM-based process is getting more and more attention, and even BIM-based quantity take-off at the most detailed level has been performed in several building projects in South Korea. The practitioners involved in those projects have pointed out that modeling rough and finish interior of a building occupies a big portion of time in the whole modeling process and the manual modeling for interior is error-prone, which could cause serious result, such as wrong cost estimation and disputes. To resolve the problem, this research proposes an automated modeling method that model a building interior automatically after selecting an interior method by a room or space basis. This research develops a interior modeling method and a system that can model various rough and finish interior components automatically at once after a user select the type of interior for a given space or room. To do so, this research identifies typical interior types of buildings and a house built in South Korea, and develops a mechanism that can support modeling both typical and non-typical types of interior by allowing the flexibility in selecting interior material and components and the order of construction process for the selected items. The automated modeling system for building interior has been preliminarily tested at a typical condominium building project and found that the system could improve dramatically the productivity of BIM-based quantity take-off and estimation process."

Thus, cost estimators need reliable estimation strategies. In practice, parametric cost estimation, which utilizes historical cost data, is the most commonly used method in these initial phases. Therefore, compilation of historical data pertaining to appropriate cost variance governing parameters is a prime requirement. However, data mining (data preprocessing) for denoising internal errors or abnormal values must be performed before this compilation.

The cost of 11 different school buildings, which are within the Konya Province of Turkey and in the first degree earthquake zone and for which earthquake strengthening decisions are taken was found out, the supplementary reinforced concrete shear walls and column jacketing were determined by carrying out strengthening analyses of these schools and the construction costs of the strengthening was calculated. Concerning the estimation of the strengthening cost, the construction and strengthening costs were subjected to simple regression analyses. The outcomes have shown by using the construction cost that the strengthening cost can be estimated with -0.0201% accuracy. © 2010 Academic Journals."

This paper introduces the element of risk in the cost estimation of land transport infrastructure projects. The paper is structured on the recommendations from the Evans and Peck (2008a) report on 'Best Practice Cost Estimation for Publicly Funded Road and Rail Construction' undertaken and adopted by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (DITRDLG). The essentials of risk analysis are provided, including several issues encountered by practitioners. A comparison of the P50 versus P90 cost estimation, including discussions on how to deal with the current practice of pricing contingencies in project cost estimation is undertaken. With the use of a generic project example, an empirical application of the P50 and P90 cost estimation is demonstrated. This paper is intended to draw the attention of transport agencies to the Best Practice Cost Estimation ('the Standard') in the preparation of cost estimates for any proposed project(s) that require funding from the Australian Government."

Specifically, the method allows one to avoid steel bridge girder splices and design the steel sections for the self weight and the weight of the slab as simply supported and then the addition of live load and remaining dead loads as continuous. This balances the moments between the positive and negative regions allowing for a prismatic section and even adds speed of construction since the field splices are not needed. In 2006, the Colorado DOT sponsored a study to (1) review current approaches to simple-made-continuous using standard rolled sections and (2) develop design charts for rapid sizing of steel bridge beams and cost estimation for simple-made-continuous.

Especially in the conceptual and schematic design stages, owners require precise cost estimates than their information providing. However, information related to the project scope is more likely to change in the early design phases in response to ongoing scope changes. Also, as only minimal project scope information is available during the early stages of estimation, cost estimators require effective estimation strategies. In practice, parametric cost estimation - which utilizes historical cost data - is the most commonly used method in these initial phases. Therefore, compilation of historical data pertaining to appropriate cost variance governing parameters is a prime requirement. However, data mining (data preprocessing) for denoising internal errors or abnormal values must be performed before this compilation. To address these issues, this research utilizes applied statistical methods, and it develops an alternative cost model based on these. To construct the model, the building cost data of 124 apartment projects, which are selected for case study, in Korea are compiled. The main objectives of the suggested model are to effectively prepare strategic and conceptual cost estimates, and to provide check and control functions during the conceptual and schematic design stages. The cost model is expected to provide more accurate and stable estimates than the conventional methods."

By the present cost estimation method, the railway project to be constructed is resolved into parts and items and the similarity of the parts and items are judged by men; the cost of the parts and items with points of similarity is estimated on the basis of the quota indices or the linear relationship model of the similar engineering data; the cost of the parts and items without points of similarity is deduced by comparison and integration with reference to similar projects and expert experience. Large amount of work is involved and the estimation results in possible errors and unstable reliability. Based on the CS (cost-significant) and WLC (whole life cost)theory, the CSIs (cost-significant items)model is set up in this paper to estimate the WLC. When a newly-built railway project has no similar engineering projects, its CSIs are dealt with by fuzzy clustering (FC) and divided into CSIs with similarity and CSIs without similarity. The cost of the former can be forecasted by FC. The cost of the latter and the CSF data can be estimated with the fuzzy inference system (FIS), thus taking full advantage of expert experience. The workload and procedure of calculation are simplified and the accuracy of estimation is improved. The comprehensive cost estimation method by CSIs, FIS, WLC and FC is suitable for high-tech projects which use new construction techniques and methods, have a small quantity of samples and lack similar engineering projects."

Both underestimates and overestimates may present problems to clients and contractors. Not surprisingly, cost-engineering activities can be stressful for those responsible. Coping with the stresses requires action on the part of the individuals affected and the organizations to which they belong. This paper examines the effect of organizational supports in the process of project estimation through a survey of construction estimation participants in Hong Kong. Using correlation analysis and regression analysis, it is found that: (1) the stressors of autonomy and feedback are directly related to the stress experienced by cost engineers; (2) informal organizational supports (particularly concerning relationship conflict, Type A behavior, work underload, lack of autonomy, and unfair rewards and treatment) are far more effective than formal supports in reducing stress; and (3) lack of autonomy and lack of feedback are predictable variables affecting stress. Cost-engineering managers and supervisors need to carefully distinguish between those who prefer hands-on support and those who prefer hands-off support. A good communication and team decision-making process and a fair reward and treatment system may help establish close relationships among cost engineers in a company and ensure sufficient autonomy to cost engineers and the participants in the estimation process. © 2008 ASCE."

Tax payers and their representatives want faster answers. Construction firms need to efficiently predict their income and their subcontractor payments. And change orders that are inevitable in any project need to be documented, approved and tracked to ensure proper payment. We are better able to address these needs in this age of information technology. Better yet, we can adapt standard processes that have stood the test of time, while simultaneously applying automation that smoothes the procedures and facilitates better sharing of the information. This paper is designed to provide guidance to all stakeholders working towards a successful transportation construction project and describes how automation and good business processes can augment their practices. Once the pre-construction work (design, cost estimation, advertisement and tendering) is complete and the contract awarded, are we starting our construction phase with a blank sheet of paper? We shouldn't be! We don't want to waste any of the keystrokes that were previously used in the project lifecycle. We should automatically load the contracts and plans into the construction management system and derive the maximum benefit from our previous effort. This paper reviews the following key functionality: Track all labor and materials that make up each estimate / payment. Add change orders to a contract so that the new line items of material and labor are indistinguishable from the original contract. Have all daily work reports by inspectors and their supervisor approvals captured and kept in one system. Govern our construction processes using automated business rules that are enforced by the system. Over-ride the business rules, if needed, but keep those over-rides noted in the system. Materials sampling, testing, and tracking are simplified. The materials are associated with a construction contract. The proper testing and approval of materials become a part of the criteria for an estimate / payment. Additionally, the tests are assigned to and test results accepted only from personnel with the proper material testing certifications. The material processes are governed by automated business rules that are enforced by the system. There is an ability to over-ride by management if needed, but those over-rides are noted in the system. This paper looks at successful management practices and the application of automation to better administer construction projects. It outlines a comprehensive set of processes that provide a ""closed loop"" of construction activities and payments for those activities. The benefits of the paper point to consistency in process and results."

A large part of the research efforts involves the development of statistical models based on historical data. Since there are a lot of models that can be fitted to certain data, a crucial issue is the selection of the most efficient prediction model. Most often this selection is based on comparisons of various accuracy measures that are functions of the model's relative errors. However, the usual practice is to consider as the most accurate prediction model the one providing the best accuracy measure without testing if this superiority is in fact statistically significant. This policy can lead to unstable and erroneous conclusions since a small change in the data is able to turn over the best model selection. On the other hand, the accuracy measures used in practice are statistics with unknown probability distributions, making the testing of any hypothesis, by the traditional parametric methods, problematic. In this paper, the use of statistical simulation tools is proposed in order to test the significance of the difference between the accuracy of two prediction methods: regression and estimation by analogy. The statistical simulation procedures involve permutation tests and bootstrap techniques for the construction of confidence intervals for the difference of measures. Four known datasets are used for experimentation in order to validate the results and make comparisons between the simulation methods and the traditional parametric and non-parametric procedures. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This, however, has been largely neglected by most previous studies. The rate stability, the main issue of this article, is the phenomenon that the rate vibrates in a fairly narrow range. Compared with the fluctuation of the rate, the continuous vibration can be deemed as a constant rate on the time axis. A lack of awareness of the rate stability results in the inaccurate estimate of project cost variance. To tackle this problem, the multi-interval cost rate model, MICOR, is proposed to explicitly evaluate the variation due to the rate stability of the project cost. Furthermore, a new simulation mechanism, which effortlessly integrates the rate stability into the simulations of the construction project's cost, is designed to facilitate the MICOR after the theoretical feasibility of the MICOR is analytically verified.

The first system consisted of two anaerobic and one facultative pond, the second and third systems were constituted by two anaerobic, two facultative, and one maturation pond, on a pilot scale, arranged in series. The three-pond systems achieved an efficiency of 91% for the removal of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and 87% for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). A mathematical model to minimize treatment costs for these wastes was developed, within economic concepts. A simulation of costs was made for a treatment system with a flow rate of 20 m 3/day and an efficiency level of about 90% for TCOD and TKN removal. The costs were US$812.40 for earth, US$6,360.60 for construction, US$4,530.90 for lining, and US$6,760.70 for pond maintenance, resulting in a total cost of US$18,464.60 for this flow rate and a unitary cost of the order of US$1.30 per swine/year. © 2007 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers."

Knowledge of the differences in costs per kilometre, including explanations of differences and their breakdowns is currently lacking in the literature. This paper aims to provide a first stage insight into how cost per kilometre varies across urban rail projects. The methodology applied is a simple cost comparison across projects where the data collected are comparable. We conclude that capital costs per route-kilometre of urban rail vary highly between projects. Looking at European projects and excluding outliers, the total capital costs per route-kilometre (including stations and rolling stock) lie mainly between US$50-1 00 million (2002 prices). Including US projects, the range is US$50-150 million. The main reasons for the high variation in the route-kilometre costs are differences between projects as regards the ratio of underground to above-ground construction, ground conditions, station spacing, type of rolling stock environmental and safety constraints and labour costs. We warn, however, that the observations used to reach the conclusions are too few to obtain results with statistical significance. Our results must therefore be seen as a first step towards collecting more data so that a more succinct statistical analysis can be conducted. Another conclusion is therefore that this area has future research potential."

Microtunneling is a trenchless technique that is used to install new pipelines. Microtunneling can be applied in gravity and pressure lines, permanent ducts for cables, and crossings under rails or roads. When bidding a microtunneling project, the main concern of microtunneling contractors is predicting the underground behavior of the machine. In other words, the productivity of microtunneling is the key to profit in microtunneling projects. Contractors generally predict approximate productivity based on experience, which risks cost estimation accuracy for microtunneling projects. Contractors lack a productivity model that helps them to predict driving time. This paper is a part of a series of papers covering the productivity of microtunneling projects.

Particularly, water inrushing from excavated face is a typical example of geotechnical risk factors which cause serious damage. However, cost variation caused by geotechnical risk factors mentioned above has not been investigated sufficiently until now, since it has been born by construction owners with deep pocket. From such a viewpoint, this paper focuses on estimation of cost variation caused by water inrushing from excavated face in a tunnel. In detail, this study adopts DFN (Discrete Fracture Network) model, which is often used for seepage analysis in discontinuous media, to simulate groundwater behavior due to tunnel excavation. Seepage analysis based on Monte Carlo Simulation, which select analytical parameters concerning information on fractures involved in DFN model as random variables, is conducted to evaluate discharge along excavated tunnel. And, in accordance with plan, which prescribes cost of countermeasures against water inrushing, the relationship between cost of countermeasures and corresponding exceedance probability, which is so-called Risk Curve, is obtained. Furthermore, Value at Risk (VaR), which is a popular index to evaluate the occurrence of unwanted events and/or losses based on Risk Curve in financial engineering, is adopted as an index to evaluate cost of countermeasures. The adoption of an index in accordance with financial engineering helps project participants, whose major is not engineering, to make decision on execution of underground construction projects. Furthermore, the methodology proposed in this paper is applied to cost estimation of tunnel countermeasures due to water inrushing in a tunnel to be excavated by TBM method in underground research facility. Finally, results make it clear that methodology proposed in this paper is very effective to investigate cost variation risk caused by encounter of fault and fractured zones during construction."

The models appeared to be more accurate than the traditional method. Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from historical office building projects, which were then, adjusted using the construction price index. The step-wise regression was conducted to produce the linear cost models. Findings - Seven RC office buildings and 11 steel office buildings in Hong Kong completed in different years were selected randomly to verify the accuracy of the regression models developed. The data of these buildings were not used in the development of the cost models. The result shows that the variability of percentage difference is ranging from -4.11 per cent (4.11 per cent underestimate) to +2.74 per cent (2.74 per cent overestimate) for RC office buildings. For steel office buildings, it ranges from -6.65 per cent (6.65 per cent underestimate) to +2.78 per cent (2.78 per cent overestimate). Research limitations/implications - This study presents a methodology that can be used in cost estimation of office buildings in Hong Kong at early stage of construction project. The regression cost models developed above are based on, in total, historical data of 30 completed office buildings in Hong Kong. The reliability of the cost models can be further improved by including more office buildings to develop the cost models. Furthermore, the application of cost modelling by regression analysis is not limited to office buildings. The same approach can be applied to residential and other non-residential buildings as well. Regression cost modelling, with sufficient updating for new cost data available, can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at early stage of construction projects. It will become rational guide supplementing judgmental forecast of cost advisors in near future. Originality/value - Step-wise regression procedure was applied to develop the cost models. Jackknife re-sampling was carried out and both of the models show stability. Cross-validation shows that the developed regression models performed satisfactorily. The paper considers that it can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at the early stage of construction project. In addition, the approach of this study can be adopted to develop cost models of other types of buildings in other locations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The basic theories of BPNN, CS and WLC are introduced and their applications are illustrated with an example in this paper. From the example, we can see that the relative errors are small enough for accuracy demand of cost estimations after simulation, and test result shows that the model based on CSIs, WLC and BPNN theorems is accurate and successful. © 2007 IEEE."

However, the cost of construction is normally assumed to be route-independent for a specific project area, resulting in sub-optimal layouts. This is especially true for mountainous terrain and in areas with unstable subsoil. Here, we present a model for more accurately estimating spatial variability in road life-cycle costs, based on terrain surface properties as well as geological properties of the subsoil. This parametric model incorporates four structural components: embankment, retaining structures, pavement, and drainage and stream-crossing structures. It is linked to a geo-database that allows users to derive location-specific parameter values as input. In applying this model, we have demonstrated that variability in costs ranges widely for mountainous areas, with the most expensive construction being approximately five times greater there than on more favorable sites. This variability strongly affects the optimal layout of a road network. First, when location-specific slope gradients are considered, costs are reduced by about 17% from those calculated via currently available engineering practices; when both slope gradient and geotechnical formations are included, those costs are decreased by about 20%. Second, the length of the road network is increased by about 4% and 10% respectively, compared with current practices. © Springer-Verlag 2006."

This technique seems to be a logic approach since in the preliminary stage of a construction project the cost estimation is not expected to be a very accurate one. Nevertheless, more accurate and proper estimation in a preliminary phase of construction project is needed as important information to the owner's decision making process. Since the inflation or consumer price index reflects the average changes in prices of consumed goods and services over the time, the use of these indices for building cost estimation will lead to inaccurate and improper estimation.

Several authors have formulated different risk management approaches. Among all methodologies, risk management process (RMP) methodology provides a logically consistent framework for managing risk.

The procedure considers types of materials and the structural shapes of the AutoCAD drawings to compute the cost of the structural skeleton elements using interactive automation. The main concept focuses on using layer computation of the AutoCAD drawing after converting it into a drawing inter-exchangeable file format (DXF). Once the coordinates are detected, it is easier to determine the area and volume for any structural shape, including circles and polygons. The extracting method is a new technique for structural engineers and quantity surveyors to estimate required material for beam, columns, slabs and foundations. The algorithm extracts and recognizes the layers and objects from a two dimensional DXF drawing along with the coordinates information. The results obtained using this technique are more accurate and reliable than manual procedures or any other traditional techniques. In this paper, an automated and interactive procedure for B.o.Q computation is demonstrated. The process involves a user-friendly interface, dynamic linking to the structural drawings and tracking of B.o.Q modifications at the same time. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In particular, the structural design of buildings consists of a long series of unit steps and is nonprocedural and data intensive compared with structural analysis problems that are procedural and computation intensive. Hence, there is a need to investigate the characteristics of the problem and to structure design information properly to effectively manage it in the structural design process. This paper discusses modeling concepts for managing design information efficiently and supporting the design process effectively. Type-local instance-global instance object modeling is the conceptual backbone of the model in this study and provides consistent modeling of structural components including not only primitive members such as beams and columns, but also composite elements such as floors, frames, and even whole buildings. This paper also provides core and extended object concepts for classifying structural design information into an overall design and for processing dependent temporary stages in the design. Foundational and application object concepts are introduced for extending the model to various types of structures. An integrated structural design system for buildings is developed based on these modeling concepts, and finally a brief discussion of the application of the object model throughout the entire structural design process in the integrated structural design system is given.

A key factor for a successful project is the preparation of an accurate estimate, which can influence factors ranging from project feasibility to profitability. The success or failure of a project is dependent on the accuracy of several estimates throughout the course of the project. Construction estimating is the compilation and analysis of many items that influence and contribute to the cost of a project. The purpose of this paper is to identify the essential factors related to cost estimation and to show the degree of importance of these factors in cost estimation of construction projects in the Gaza strip from contractors’ perspective. The results of analyzing fifty one factors considered in a questionnaire survey concluded that the main factors are: location of the project, segmentation of the Gaza strip and limitation of movements between areas, political situation and closure of the Gaza strip, financial status of the owner and increase in unit costs of construction materials. It is recommended to review cost estimation practice in terms of education and training required for those responsible for the estimating process.

Government needs to effectively monitor the design process from beginning to end instead of just allocating money and that a different approach is needed in the provisions of infrastructure service schemes. While there are numerous political, social and economical aspects of the infrastructure services problem, there is a great need for appropriate technical solutions. Due to the civil engineering industry's rapid growth, cuts in the infrastructure budget, poor forecasting techniques and insufficient research methodology, the danger of cost overruns, wastage and proper control of the budget is increasing substantially. Public planners spend very little time generating alternative project options, often presenting decision- makers with only a few poorly differentiated alternatives borrowed ad hoc from other projects. As one goes through the procedural framework, it is intended to draw up some generic cost estimation from the different design scenarios and levels of services for roads, stormwater, sewer and water on infrastructure projects. The proposed decision tool, with the use of process guidelines, assists in the levels of services option, quantitative and specification selection processes and will prove very useful for consultants and clients. It uses a systems' thinking approach to identify and cost elemental parts of design, which appear to be more or less expensive than they might have expected. This model takes the problem of inaccurate cost prediction and provides a methodology for forecasting the total cost for the project in various stages of the project by mapping the choices of design in the form of a decision tree in which all scenarios can be demonstrated and evaluated.The goal for continuous improvement in the infrastructure sector can be achieved through the proposed framework and sound management practices at design stage. This, together with basic values and principles of cost planning and construction economics can contribute to the concept of ""affordable township infrastructure"" and will result in a delivery system that becomes more efficient and effective."

Over the time span between the initiation of a project and the completion of construction many factors influence a project's final costs.

Microtunneling is a trenchless technique that is used in installation of new pipelines. Microtunneling can be applied in gravity and pressure lines, permanent ducts for cables, and crossings under rails or roads. When bidding a microtunneling project, the main concern of microtunneling contractors is predicting the underground behavior of the machine. In other words, the microtunneling productivity is the key for profit in microtunneling projects. Contractors use their own experience in predicting approximate productivity, which risks cost estimation accuracy for microtunneling projects. Contractors lack productivity models that help them in predicting overall project time. Predicting the overall time for microtunneling projects in different soil types using probabilistic analysis methods is the purpose of this paper. Low, medium, and high performance operation is considered in the models. Contractors can use the models in predicting the overall project time through different soil types in bidding phase. Contractors can use it as well to evaluate the performance of project team. Researcher can use these models to start a more detailed analysis of the bidding process of microtunneling projects."

Then the FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) is applied to estimate the CSIs and csf(cost-significant factor) with no performed data. The basic theories of BPNN, CS , FISand WLC are introduced and their applications are illustrated with an example in this paper. From the example, we can see that the relative errors are small enough for accuracy demand of cost estimations after simulation, and test result shows that the model based on CSIs, WLC and BPNN theorems is accurate and successful. © 2007 IEEE."

Quite often it is a part of the investment process. In the authors' opinion, wrong assumptions as to the cost of the right of way taken during the planning process could be a reason of non-optimal transmission investment decisions. That is why currently decision makers should focus on incorporation of the right of way into the process of long/medium term transmission planning. Nowadays the right of way has become in Poland an important issue. Real estate prices went up dramatically, much higher than the inflation rate, as a result of positive macroeconomic indexes. This is a reason why people find a new perspective for owning the land, and do not want to permit construction of a new transmission line over their estate or even close by. The right of way in Poland consists of two main issues. Firstly, it is an agreement between an investor and a real estate owner, which allows the investor to obtain a building permit and commence implementation of an investment project. Secondly, it is a notarial deed and the purpose is to establish an easement appurtenant. In the traditional approach, even in sophisticated software tools used by TSOs, the user is creating development alternatives. Depending on the criterion function, the user is also defining economic rates including the investment cost for each alternative. Typically, the investment cost is a product of the line length and the average cost of building 1 km of a new transmission line. Consistently, the average investment cost means also the average value of compensation paid to real estate owners. However, what is actually meant by average, if compensation could vary greatly. If the criterion function for selecting the best development alternative is a minimum discounted costs function in a defined period of time, the results' quality will be directly proportional to reality of the investment cost estimation. This suggests necessity to change the approach to estimation of investment costs of development options, including the cost of the right of way. Instead of assuming averaged values, alternatively, it is possible to conduct simplified feasibility studies, use expert methods for estimation or develop dedicated software. Following analysis of advantages and disadvantages of particular solutions, the first two options have been chosen as preferred ones in the initial period. In the long term, use of indicator-based expert methods is recommended, after development and verification of adequacy of the applied models."

In this situation, appropriate data for some of the plant systems may be lacking to develop a bottom-up cost estimate. Therefore, a more global approach, the Top-Down Approach (TDA), is needed to help the designers and decision makers in comparing design options. It utilizes more or less simple models for cost estimating the different parts of a design. TDA cost estimating effort applies to a whole functional element whose cost is approached by similar estimations coming from existing data, ratios and models, for a given range of variation of parameters. Modeling is used when direct analogy is not possible. There are two types of models, global and specific ones. Global models are applied to cost modules related to Code Of Account. Exponential formulae such as Ci = Ai + (Bi x Pi "") are used when there are cost data for comparable modules in nuclear or other industries. Specific cost models are developed for major specific components of the plant: - process equipment such as reactor vessel, steam generators or large heat exchangers. - buildings, with formulae estimating the construction cost from base cost of m3 of building volume. - systems, when unit costs, cost ratios and models are used, depending on the level of detail of the design. Bottom Up Approach (BUA), which is based on unit prices coming from similar equipment or from manufacturer consulting, is very valuable and gives better cost estimations than TDA when it can be applied, that is at a rather late stage of the design. Both approaches are complementary when some parts of the design are detailed enough to be estimated by BUA, and when BUA results are used to check TDA results and to improve TDA models. TDA for nuclear designs has been inspired by methods and models developed in other industries and validated on existing reactors and detailed designs cost estimated by BUA. The presentation describes the top-down approach and shows through examples, as a specific study on an HTR reactor design, how the two approaches complement each other more and more as the project engineering progresses through the design phases: pre-conceptual, conceptual, preliminaiy, detailed, specifications, bidding. This is the objective of the EMWG (Economic Modeling Working Group) of Gen IV, which has endorsed the approaches and their complementarities. For HTR direct construction, a specific effort has been made for cost estimating vessels and structures of the reactor plant equipment, which are specific of the concept. Also, further improvement of the Top-down approach is presented. Finally, the paper concludes on the optimal conditions of utilization of the TDA and BUA approaches."

This paper presents details of replacement cost modeling for each bridge component (superstructure, substructure, approach, and other costs) for bridges with concrete slab, concrete beam, or steel superstructures. This was done with recent bridge construction data on the Indiana state highway network. It was determined that costs other than substructure and superstructure costs accounted for more than one-half of total replacement cost The present study supports earlier studies by asserting that basic bridge characteristics such as type, length, and deck area may generally be used to derive reliable estimates of bridge replacement costs. The study also shows that economies of scale can play a significant role in reliable bridge cost estimation. It was determined that the average overall unit cost of replacement for steel superstructure bridges was generally lower than that for concrete superstructure bridges. It was seen that differences in replacement costs across bridge types are attributable not necessarily to cost differences in material and construction procedure only but also to economy-of-scale effects. Cost models can be used to predict total costs of future bridge replacements and are therefore useful for vital bridge management functions such as needs assessments, budgeting, and programming."

Productivity of TT techniques is affected by a number of subjective factors that need to be evaluated. A productivity index (PI) model is developed in order to represent this subjective effect in refining productivity assessment. The analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy logic are used to develop the proposed PI model that relies on the actual performance of 12 subfactors under three main categories: management, environmental, and physical conditions. The developed PI model resulted in PI equal to 0.7323 and 0.7251 for microtunneling and horizontal directional drilling (HDD) projects, respectively. Multiattribute decision support system software is developed to determine the PI for a specific TT technique using Visual Basic. The PI model is tested, which shows reasonable results.

This review led to development of a simple prioritization methodology with which to analyze the projects. Unit costs per ride were calculated to facilitate comparisons between the various proposals. The cost estimation procedure involved a systematic sequence of analyses that included the development and quantification of conceptual design elements, application of unit capital as well as operation and maintenance costs, and matching of annualized costs with annual rider-ship to derive unit costs per affected ride. Results revealed that the greater majority of proposed improvements could be implemented at a relatively low total cost. The estimates also suggest that most proposed improvements will not add very significant additional costs per ride to existing operations. The case study demonstrates the utility of a prioritization method that emphasizes the user benefits of projects and illustrates an approach that could be used by other agencies."

Solutions which cover all stages of the value creation chain such as e-tendering, costestimation, cost-determination, and production must be anytime accessible and platform independent. While the basic conditions of IT-infrastructure (digital networks) are today fully sufficient, the compatibility between the systems and the information to be exchanged represent the largest problem. The main problem is in the range of different systems and various information domains. Transformations and adjustments of the exchanged information still cost nearly 40 % of design and engineering time. Efficient information exchanges require a universal exchange format, which makes the existing systems compatible.

The types of stress can be divided into objective stress (OS), subjective stress (SS) and emotional exhaustion (EE). The research described in this paper examined the relationships between OS, SS, EE and stressors based on a survey of construction cost estimation personnel. T-tests, factor analyses, correlation analyses and regression analyses were applied to identify differences between the professional estimators and other personnel, and the types of stress endured. The results indicate that the stress levels of both the professional estimators and other personnel are similar, with OS being significantly higher than SS, which is in turn significantly higher than EE. For professional estimators, increased levels of OS were found to be mainly associated with lack of autonomy and unfair reward and treatment. Increased SS and EE, on the other hand, appeared to be a function of relationship conflict, work underload, lack of feedback, lack of autonomy and unfair reward and treatment."

Using correlation analysis, regression analysis and structural equation modelling, the relationships between stress and various aspects of estimation performance are examined and a causal structural model is developed. The results indicate that stress is a cause of negative estimation performance (resulting in weak interpersonal relationships, unfamiliarity with organization and ineffective process), while, simultaneously, it is beneficial to the professional estimation performance.

Underlying principles and basic steps of cost estimation based on cost significant work packages was explained by means of manual calculations. Findings - In order to automate the manual building cost estimation process, the software based on cost significant work packages was developed. Research limitations/implications - The software is currently in the testing phase and is being used for educational purposes. Making use of both public sector and current market prices in the cost estimation process, increasing number of projects stored in the database for more accurate results, estimating costs of different types of projects and calculating the cost significant value factor more precisely by using statistical techniques, those being employed by global cost models are suggested for future research. Practical implications - As the number of the similar projects in database is increased, the accuracy of the cost estimation is also increased.

Many different data sources are available to estimate the construction cost of a refinery unit, including government organizations, private and public companies, commercial databases, trade and academic publications and press releases for licensors and companies. Capital costs for refining units are frequently specified as a function of capacity and scaled using the power-law relation. However, every cost estimate involves uncertainty due to differing qualities of equipment fabrication, design differences, market conditions, vendor profit and others. The cost curves can be assumed to have an accuracy limited to ±25%. Utility requirements for each process are usually presented on a per-barrel unit feed or product basis and correspond to average characteristics associated with the mid-point of the construction cost curve. The cost of data of units of roughly comparable design and technology are normalized with respect to construction requirements, process specifications, location and time of installation. A refinery's complexity indicates how complex it is in relation to a refinery that performs only crude distillation, given by a complexity index R. Meanwhile, an estimate of the purchase cost at a given time is obtained by multiplying the original quoted cost at time by a ratio of cost indexes."

The technology of co-gasification can result in very clean power plants using a wide range of solid fuels but there are considerable economic and environmental challenges. The aim of this study is to present the available existing co-gasification techniques and projects for coal and solid wastes and to investigate the techno-economic feasibility, concerning the installation and operation of a 30 MWe co-gasification power plant based on integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology, using lignite and refuse derived fuel (RDF), in the region of Western Macedonia prefecture (WMP), Greece. The gasification block was based on the British Gas-Lurgi (BGL) gasifier, while the gas clean-up block was based on cold gas purification. The competitive advantages of co-gasification systems can be defined both by the fuel feedstock and production flexibility but also by their environmentally sound operation. It also offers the benefit of commercial application of the process by-products, gasification slag and elemental sulphur. Co-gasification of coal and waste can be performed through parallel or direct gasification. Direct gasification constitutes a viable choice for installations with capacities of more than 350 MWe. Parallel gasification, without extensive treatment of produced gas, is recommended for gasifiers of small to medium size installed in regions where coal-fired power plants operate. The preliminary cost estimation indicated that the establishment of an IGCC RDF/lignite plant in the region of WMP is not profitable, due to high specific capital investment and in spite of the lower fuel supply cost. The technology of co-gasification is not mature enough and therefore high capital requirements are needed in order to set up a direct co-gasification plant. The cost of electricity estimated was not competitive, compared to the prices dominating the Greek electricity market and thus further economic evaluation is required. The project would be acceptable if modular construction of the unit was first adopted near operating power plants, based on parallel co-gasification, and gradually incorporating the remaining process steps (gas purification, power generation) with the aim of eventually establishing a true direct co-gasification plant. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is important, because labor not only constitutes a large part of construction cost, but also susceptible to the influence of construction management. Indonesian construction industry needs a series of productivity indices, which should be designed to allow contractors to compare the performance of their projects with other similar projects, and to analyze different type of construction processes in order to identify problem areas and potential for productivity improvement at the source of problems. Appropriate construction productivity measurement provides the basis for determining trends and levels of productivity as well as the impacts of corrective action. It will assist project owners and construction managers: to manage projects effectively; to detect problems and adverse trends for necessary corrective action; to determine impacts of changed construction methods or conditions; to identify high and low areas of productivity and reasons for the differences; to compare project performance by region; to compare performance of different contractors; and to provide a means to assess cost effectiveness in construction. This paper discusses the method for measuring standard worker's performance and productivity rates for improving construction cost estimation, and for assisting the definition of worker/job performance standards. Observations had been conducted in selected road and bridge construction projects at 13 provinces in Indonesia. Data obtained from observation of work processes and time measurements at the various construction sites were evaluated and analyzed to obtain productivity and performance indicators at project, regional and national levels. Non-productive activity time measurement will then be used as a tool to improve the worker performance by introducing corrective and preventive actions for every non-productive working elemen. © 2006 by School of Engineering and Technology, Asian Institute of Technology."

Those databases often integrate data coming from projects of a heterogeneous nature. This entails that it is difficult to obtain a reasonably reliable single parametric model for the range of diverging project sizes and characteristics. A solution proposed elsewhere for that problem was the use of segmented models in which several models combined into a single one contribute to the estimates depending on the concrete characteristic of the inputs. However, a second problem arises with the use of segmented models, since the belonging of concrete projects to segments or clusters is subject to a degree of fuzziness, i.e. a given project can be considered to belong to several segments with different degrees. This paper reports the first exploration of a possible solution for both problems together, using a segmented model based on fuzzy clusters of the project space. The use of fuzzy clustering allows obtaining different mathematical models for each cluster and also allows the items of a project database to contribute to more than one cluster, while preserving constant time execution of the estimation process. The results of an evaluation of a concrete model using the ISBSG 8 project database are reported, yielding better figures of adjustment than its crisp counterpart. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Typically, the accuracy of the cost estimate will be dependant upon the amount of time applied and the quality of the data utilized. However, the dictates of time do not always enable the designer, developer or contractor the luxury of a carefully researched cost estimate.

Ten highway sections in Michigan were chosen and grouped into four case studies. Their estimated and actual accumulated costs and maintenance schedules were compared. While results indicate that MDOT LCCA procedure correctly predicts the pavement type with lower initial construction cost, actual costs are usually lower than estimated in the LCCA.

In those two stages cost estimations are affected by many uncertain factors, and the relationship among them is nonlinear and the traditional model is hard to solve them. This paper applies the CSC Cost-significant) theorem to simplify cost estimation, and sets up the forecasting methods of CSIs (Cost-significant Items) of WLC (Whole Life Cost). Then the BPNN (Back-propagation Neural Network) model is made up according to the BP algorithm to 'distill' CSIs and CSF (cost-significant factor) from the data and information of completed projects, which provides a practical solution for those problems according to the nonlinear theory. The basic theories of BPNN, CS and WLC are introduced and their applications are illustrated with an example. From the example, we can see that the relative errors are so small that they can meet the accuracy demand of cost estimations after simulation, and the test result shows that the model based on the BPNN, CSIs and WLC theorems is accurate and successful."

This research aims to develop a system architecture for a preliminary cost estimation system that toggles project input information, predictive item-level quantity, and segregates unit price of highway projects. Item-level quantity models at project outset were developed using cost data that are stored in Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Design and Construction Information System (DCIS). The basic estimating parameters were derived from statistical analyses and then documented so that the data with the system could be continuously updated. The statistical models are embedded in a Web-based relational database management system (RDBMS). These models are then used for computation and data storage purposes.

However, efforts to address these tasks to date have suffered from the lack of a mechanism for automatically inferring conditions such as uniformity/similarity in a facility's spatial configuration. Identifying these conditions is crucial for evaluating the suitability of a construction method as they affect criteria such as reuse and achievable production rates. In the absence of such a mechanism researchers have relied on either statistical techniques that can be biased by outliers, or simply put the onus on the user by querying them about the number of reuses, etc. which undermines the usefulness of the system itself. In this paper, we introduce an algorithmic technique based on hierarchical clustering that can be used to infer the similarity of part or all of a construction facility with respect to any measure of interest - such as length, area, volume, and so on. The advantage of this technique is that it is immune to outliers in the data set, and it can accommodate the intuitive notion of acceptable variability. For example, in an expert's judgment, a six percent variability in the dimensions of slab-bays is acceptable for use of flying truss formwork as it can be accommodated with infill panels or hinge panels. We start by providing a motivating example from the domain of building construction, and illustrate how the techniques adopted by researchers to date fail in the case of various spatial configurations. We then provide the hierarchical clustering algorithm in detail after a short discussion of our technique for representing the project's physical context. Finally, we illustrate how the algorithm has been integrated with a project management system that provides a hierarchical representation of the physical view of a facility, and a production rule based expert system to aid in the selection of construction methods."

Several elaborated methodologies, which aid the development of ontologies for particular application requirements, emerged in the last decades. Nevertheless, in order for ontologies to be built and deployed at a large scale, beyond the boundaries of the academic community, one needs not only technologies and tools to assist the engineering process, but also means to estimate and control its overall costs. These issues are addressed only marginally by current engineering approaches, though their importance is well recognized in the community. A first attempt to bridge this gap has been made with the ONTOCOM (Ontology Cost Model) approach [10], which provides an instrument to estimate the efforts involved in building, reusing and maintaining ontologies. Just as in the adjacent field of software engineering, a discipline in which cost prediction models belong to standard development environments, ONTOCOM proposes a top-down, parametric cost estimation method on the basis of pre-defined process stages and cost drivers. ONTOCOM is based on a work breakdown structure which complies to the process model recommended by all established ontology engineering methodologies. It differentiates between four main process stages: 1). requirements analysis; 2). conceptualization; 3). implementation; and 4). evaluation. For these categories, cost drivers influencing the required effort (in terms of person months) have been identified on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of current engineering methodologies and related case studies. Their relevance to the cost estimation issue has been confirmed by experts in the field in a comprehensive evaluation study [10]. Every cost driver is associated with effort multipliers (from Very High to Very Low), depending on the characteristics of the corresponding project setting. A first estimation of the numerical values associated with these effort multipliers was performed based on ex post analysis of different ontology engineering efforts and preliminary expert validations with very promising results [10]. This paper explains how ONTOCOM can be applied to estimate the efforts related to ontology development in arbitrary projects. For this purpose we illustrate the usage of the general-purpose model with the help of a simple example, and then describe how this model can be further refined and customized for project settings which follow a different ontology engineering methodology. The last issue is exemplified in relation to the DILIGENT methodology, which is targeted at the construction of rapidly changing ontologies in distributed settings [14]. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. After introducing the ONTOCOM model in Section 28.2, we demonstrate how it can be applied to estimate the costs of ontology development in Section 28.3. Section 28.4 describes the steps required to adapt the generic model to new ontology engineering methodologies. This process is exemplified for the DILIGENT methodology in Section 28.5. Section 28.6 provides a brief overview of previous work which is related to ONTOCOM, while Section 28.7 summarizes the main contributions of this paper and outlines directions of future research and development."

Preparing reliable and accurate estimates to help decision makers is the most challenging assignment that cost engineers and estimators face. For decades, practitioners in the construction industry focused only on estimating the initial cost of a facility, neglecting costs associated with operating and maintaining it. Today, more interest lies in investigating the economics of facility management, which include the cost of owning and operating a building over its useful life. This paper presents a methodology that can be used for an integrated conceptual cost estimating and life-cycle cost analysis for construction projects during their initial phase. The methodology describes the development and implementation of a system that automates the preparation of parametric cost estimates and forecasts future running costs of building projects. The system integrates relational databases, a parametric cost estimate module, an AutoCAD module, a global module, a cost estimate forecasting and decision support system module, and a life cycle costing and sensitivity analysis module. The system will automatically generate a new parametric estimate upon any modification in building design. Once the capital costs are identified, the system forecasts the cost of running and maintaining the new building throughout its expected service life. After assigning the range of deviation, a sensitivity analysis is conducted, which identifies the most sensitive parameters for further consideration and analysis. Designing the system in a user-friendly environment allows owners and decision makers to envision the feasibility of new building projects within their anticipated life cycles. Moreover, it assists architects and cost engineers in generating parametric cost estimates in a dynamic environment. A numerical case example is presented to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed system. © 2007 ASCE."

Although a similar plant was discovered to have produced fresh water at a cost of 0.86 $/m3, after making a comparison of all the main factors affecting the unit cost of water it was estimated that the unit cost of water should be approximately 0.68 $/m3 for the new plant to be constructed in the university. It was observed that the unit cost is approximately 0.7 $/m3 after the plant was erected and put into operation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The design itself may only be represented in a conceptual form providing little firm information on which cost estimation rules should be applied. Aspects of the design may yet to be determined leading to a great deal of uncertainty. Consequently, there is little incentive to look into the costs of a design in anything more than an indicative manner. Early evaluation of costing can be based on weight or space depending on the type of vessel as the quantity of materials or level of outfitting can be determined with a greater level of certainly. However, the designer must be subjective in how these rules are applied and for one off or unique designs the rules applied many not be so suitable. In many cases, functionality of costing tools is similar to common spreadsheet tools with little integration into design tools. This means that the costs may have to be evaluated for every design change. Paramarine's early stage design environment is based on the Design Building Blocks methodology developed by UCL. The approach allows requirements and components of a vessel to be defined and manipulated in a fluid manner to determine a balanced arrangement. Combined with a parametrically defined structural definition, the complete design can be deconstructed into materials, equipment and construction activities allowing the producability to be evaluated before reaching the initial design stage. In both areas of the software, searchable design data is associated with semantic information (space, weight, type etc) which can be audited to identify items for cost evaluation. Time to perform a cost evaluation is reduced as is the potential for mistakes. However, the designer is left with just having to assign cost values, a potentially laborious process. This paper discusses the development of an early stage (concept) design production assessment tool, incorporating first principle approach based cost estimation tools. One of the greatest challenges involved identifying ways in which simple parametric rules can used to generate cost information based on product model data. As a result, (microscopic) cost evaluation can now be performed as early as concept design more easily than many existing subjective rule based approaches. This allows the designer to identify major cost driving factors and perform sensitivity analysis."

In most cases, this requires immense effort, a huge amount of historical data from similar projects and detailed design of the proposed development, which is usually not available in the conceptual and appraisal stages of the project. It would be valuable to have a simulation model based on stochastic functions that map a set of input parameters to a set of outputs by translating the predetermined scope to quantities and then predictive costs.This could then be used in concept selection studies, sensitivity analysis and optimisation in the front-end and development planning stages of an offshore project. This paper compares the neuro-fuzzy modelling techniques with multiple linear regression analysis in the development of cost estimating relationships and predicting the cost of offshore structures in the conceptual phase. The results are benchmarked against actual project results, comparing the accuracy, effectiveness and practicality of the both methods.This study is a part of the author's ongoing research into the development of a probabilistic cost engineering model for offshore structures at the University of Western Australia. It is expected that this research will contribute greatly to the development of decision support systems in offshore construction cost engineering and improve confidence levels in conceptual cost estimates, thus facilitating a comprehensive front-end evaluation of offshore developments especially for marginal fields."

The LNG tank construction cost is the largest single cost in a receiving terminal. The specific construction cost of LNG storage tanks have decreased with an increase in storage capacity. However, quantitatively utilizing the past experiences in cost estimation and profitability analysis was a long term unsettled task in LNG projects. Learning curve resources were accumulated by Kogas and KBR from three different types of storage tanks: membrane type aboveground tanks, 9% Nickel full containment storage tanks, and membrane type in-ground tanks (total 28 tanks, each type built at the same site). Case based construction analysis was performed in view of tank type, construction method, construction duration, accumulated experience, storage capacity, and other parameters that affect construction performance. This paper presents the effects of the Learning Curve Management (LCM) on construction performance and cost reduction based on past experiences. A re-learning factor is incorporated in the learning function and the ultimate level of performance has been implanted in the new model of the learning curve. This paper demonstrates that the LCM, derived from the case based construction analysis, provides a reasonable basis of cost analysis, cost estimation, and profitability studies, all of which are related to the evaluation of future costs and confidence level in an analysis."

For such networks we develop a comprehensive design methodology and carry out a series of numeric experiments using data coming from the area of software engineering. The construction of SONFNs exploits fundamental technologies of computational intelligence (CI), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. The architecture of the SONFN results from a synergistic usage of NFN and PNN. NFN contributes to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the SONFN. The consequence part of the SONFN is designed using PNNs. We discuss two types of SONFN architectures with the taxonomy based on the NFN scheme being applied to the premise part of SONFN and propose a comprehensive learning algorithm. It is shown that this network exhibits a dynamic structure as the number of its layers as well as the number of nodes in each layer of the SONFN are not predetermined (as this is usually the case for a popular topology of a multilayer perceptron). The experimental results deal with well-known software data such as the NASA dataset concerning software cost estimation and the one describing software modules of the medical imaging system (MIS). In comparison with the previously discussed approaches, the self-organizing networks are more accurate and exhibit superb generalization capabilities. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The two types of cost estimation in general use are scratch and bid-based (historical) estimation, the latter being most common among state DOTs. This paper reviews existing bid-based cost estimation procedures along with the software packages most often used for the estimation process. The review is based on two surveys: a state DOT survey and a software survey. Because bid-based estimations are based on selecting `similar' projects from recent past to estimate the cost of a new project, a model which uses the median prices and `similar' projects from the bid history database is used to determine costs of new projects. However, due to the shortcomings of the existing procedure, especially in determining the similarity pattern of existing projects, a different method based on the Backpropagation Neural Network is developed and evaluated against the conventional methodology. Results indicate that the neural network method outperforms the conventional procedure. The advantages and disadvantages of the neural network method as well as some thoughts for the future research in this area are presented."

However, the cost estimates prepared at this stage are usually the most important to the client. Nowadays, the costs for building services installations contribute a significant share of the total construction cost of building projects. Thus the accuracy of the building services cost estimates plays an important role in the total building construction project cost estimates. Traditionally, building services cost estimates are prepared by a deterministic single-figure (most likely) approach. This approach is often cost-ineffective and reactionary in nature. The risk management process (RMP) provides a logical consistent framework in identifying the risk factors affecting costs and in making allowances for risks in cost estimation. A survey was conducted to find out the current building services cost estimation practices and to obtain an insight into the understanding, use and application of RMP in preparing building services cost estimates within the building services industry. The results of the survey have suggested that the traditional deterministic cost estimation method is still being adopted by the majority of building services engineers in preparing cost estimates. Also, RMP has not been widely adopted by the building services industry in Hong Kong. From the analysis of building services firms and engineers with regard to the critical success factors for implementation of risk management, the survey reflects that the potential of implementing RMP for building services cost estimation is high."

CBRefurb imitates the domain expert in its approach of breaking down the whole building work into smaller work (building items) by organising the refurbishment cases as a hierarchical structure composed of cases and subcases. The process of estimation imitates the expert by considering only these pieces of previous cases of similar situation (or context). For this purpose, CBRefurb defines some of the building and its component (or items) features as a global context and local context information used to classify cases and subcases into context cases and subcases, and to decompose the cost estimation problem into adaptable subproblems. This is followed by a two indexing schemes to suit the hierarchical structure of the case and the problem decomposition and to allow classification and retrieval of contextual cases.

Estimation of workhours is an important task for a construction project. Specifically, at a very early stage of engineering or bidding, when many of the technical details are not available, estimation of workhours becomes very critical to estimate the total cost of construction for bidding on a contract. In oil, gas, and petrochemical projects, construction of a tank is one of the big construction activities that contributes a major part of the total workhours or cost of the project. For different services, there can be different types of tanks, and hence, to determine the cost of tank construction during bidding at a very early stage of engineering is difficult. This paper establishes a rule-of-thumb for the estimation of workhours for the construction of tanks. However, many rules-of-thumb are available for the estimation of workhours for construction of tanks, by the tonnage of construction or by the capacity of the tank. This paper provides a slightly more scientific approach for the estimation of workhours. We consider differences in construction methods for different types of tanks, establish the relationship of construction workhours with different parameters of the tank construction, and finally, integrate these to derive at a single rule-of-thumb or formula. Different constant multipliers for different types of tanks are also defined, which are used in the rule-of-thumb. The paper also includes a program in Foxpro for the derived rule-of-thumb/formula."

Preliminary cost estimates are necessary to support such fundamental decisions as whether to proceed with planning and design, to look for alternatives, or to abandon a project. One method often used to produce a preliminary estimate is to compare published standard average costs per unit area for similar types of projects. Two obstacles may be encountered when attempting this type of estimate: first, the published standards seldom accurately represent the actual project under consideration; and second, it is difficult to derive the likely variability in the final project cost from such generalized average unit costs. This paper discusses one method explored by Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel project to overcome these two problems. First, a generalized technique for conforming published square foot costs to schematic designs of specific projects is proposed. The paper then suggests a procedure for deriving a range of likely costs for a project, where distributions of possible values are suggested in the standards."

The trouble with truisms is that such general principles may not apply in specific cases. This paper tests the specificity of two SE truisms: (a) increasing software process level is a desirable goal; and (b) it is best to remove errors during the early parts of a software lifecycle. Our tests are based on two well-established SE models: (1) Boehm et.al.'s COCOMO II cost estimation model; and (2) Raffo's discrete event software process model of a software project life cycle. After extensive simulations of these models, the TAR2 treatment learner was applied to find the model parameters that most improved the potential performance of the real-world systems being modelled. The case studies presented here showed that these truisms are clearly sub-optimal for certain projects since other factors proved to be far more critical. Hence, we advise against truism-based process improvement. This paper offers a general alternative framework for model-based assessment of methods to improve software quality: modelling + validation + simulation + sensitivity. That is, after recording what is known in a model, that model should be validated, explored using simulations, then summarized to find the key factors that most improve model behavior. © 2002 IEEE."

Estimators must recognize the design conditions that affect construction costs and customize the cost estimate accordingly. Estimators have different preferences for how and when to adjust a project's activities, resources, and resource productivity rates that form the basis of a cost estimate. Current tools and methodologies lack ways to help estimators customize construction cost information according to their preferences and the particular features in a given design. This paper describes the process we formalized to customize a project's activities, resources, and resource productivity rates based on a project-independent representation of estimators' rationale and a project-specific feature-based product model. The formal process creates an integrated model that explicitly relates features, activities, resources, costs and the estimator's rationale. Our tests show that this process enables a software prototype to generate and maintain cost estimates quickly, consistently, and accurately for feature-based product models. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With the help of these relationships optimal dimensions of an improved high-side weir overflow chamber could be found. The steady state efficiency for this improved overflow chamber seems to be comparable to that of a hydrodynamic separator, when both devices are subjected to the same surface load. On the other hand, during real storm events, the storage inside the overflow structure can play an important role. This role is investigated by calculating the removal efficiencies for both structures when 4 monitored storm events are used as input. When higher removal efficiencies are wanted, the storage effect gets more and more important and as a consequence the hydrodynamic separator can technically as well as economically compete with simpler structures like e.g. a high-side weir overflow. These findings are confirmed by a simple construction cost estimation."

The basic premise of cost modeling is that a historical database of software project cost data can be used to develop a quantitative model to predict the cost of future projects. One of the difficulties faced by workers in this area is that many of these historical databases contain substantial amounts of missing data. Thus far, the common practice has been to ignore observations with missing data. In principle, such a practice can lead to gross biases and may be detrimental to the accuracy of cost estimation models. In this paper, we describe an extensive simulation where we evaluate different techniques for dealing with missing data in the context of software cost modelling. Three techniques are evaluated: listwise deletion, mean imputation, and eight different types of hot-deck imputation. Our results indicate that all the missing data techniques perform well with small biases and high precision. This suggests that the simplest technique, listwise deletion, is a reasonable choice. However, this will not necessarily provide the best performance. Consistent best performance (minimal bias and highest precision) can be obtained by using hot-deck imputation with Euclidean distance and a z-score standardization."

It is often more efficient to solve a problem by starting with the solution(s) to a previous similar problem than it is to generate the entire solution again from first principles. In fact, experts have been observed to reason by analogy to prior cases. Case adaptation, a central component of case-based reasoning, is often considered the most difficult part of a case-based reasoning system. The difficulties arise from the fact that adaptation does not often converge, especially if it is not done in a systematic way. This problem, sometimes termed the assimilation problem, is especially pronounced in the case-based design problem-solving domain where a large set of constraints and features are processed. Furthermore, in the steel building design domain, multiple cases must be considered in conjunction in order to solve the new problem, resulting in the difficulty of how to efficiently combine the multiple cases into one solution for the new problem. This article investigates a new technique in complex adaptation. It presents the closest retrieved cases to a neural network, thus learning about the domain of the problem being solved. The new problem is then fed to the trained neural network and the output becomes the solution to that problem. The methodology is applied to a problem in steel construction, and the sought output is the cost estimation of pre-engineered steel buildings. Several experiments are conducted to prove that these steps are successful. System verification is done and shows that both the system and the methodology are successful in developing a complete adaptation mechanism in CBR."

This concept is developed to show the ultimate cost-reduction potential of an LMFBR in its commercial stage. The electrical output is 1000 MWe, while the thermal output is 2600 MWt. Main components of the sodium cooling system are four electromagnetic pumps (EMP's) and eight double-wall-tube steam generators (SG's). They are installed in a reactor vessel like the primary pumps and the intermediate heat exchangers of the pool type LMFBR's. In case of a water leakage accident in an SG, the reactor core will be isolated by a cylindrical partition wall installed between the core and cooling components, and by siphon-break mechanisms installed in the main EMP's. The possibility of such an accident, however, is reduced to a negligible level by the use of the double-walled heat transfer tubes. While the core is isolated, the decay heat is removed by four penetrating-type direct reactor auxiliary cooling systems (DRACS's) which each have built-in pony EMP's. Preliminary cost estimation has revealed that the construction cost of the second plant, namely, the cost without the first-of-a-kind cost, could be reduced to 0.7 times those of the light water reactors."

In traditional pinch technology and mathematical programming it is usually assumed that all heat exchangers in a network obey a single cost model. This implies that all heat exchangers in a network are of the same type and use the same materials of construction (an assumption that is unwarranted). The method introduced in this article enables the designer to decomposes the total cost of a heat exchanger into two elements, namely cost of the tubes and cost of the shell, thereby predict a more reliable cost for the network. By subsequent use of the binary variables and evaluation of the physical conditions of the streams, one can assign the streams to pass either through shell or tubes. Whereby, shell and tubes can be of different materials and therefore different cost models can be applied. Another advantage of the approach is that the pressure drop in each side of the exchanger (shell or tubes) can be assessed leading to more accurate evaluation of corresponding heat transfer coefficient for each individual stream. Finally an objective function (total cost) can be defined based on mixed materials of construction and different values of heat transfer coefficients. The proposed model has been utilized in three different case studies and the results are compared with those of a commercially available software (SUPERTARGET). The comparison shows reductions of more than 17% and 14% in total annual costs in the two cases, and 2.5% reduction in third, confirming the fact that more accurate evaluation of heat transfer coefficient for each individual stream can lead to better network design."

The developed method allows to realize the pure site facilities costs using well-defined normative and heuristic rules from engineering knowledge, together with typical construction details of site installations (e.g. for accident prevention).

The basis of the claim was that the client and main contractor required the work to be executed in ways other than that originally planned by the subcontractor, reducing efficiency and so increasing costs. The authors of this paper represented the earth-moving subcontractor in a legal arbitration, in which this application of multiple linear regression analysis was fundamental to quantifying the amount claimed in the case. The analysis determined the time required to perform earth-moving tasks, based on a set explanatory variables, using data sets recorded on-site. The same equation was then applied to the plan of work used for the tender and was used to show that the comparative efficiency between tender and actual was as low as 25%. The claim was successful, and the calculations described in this paper were used to quantify a total additional payment of approximately £380 000."

Prices of each specific resource have an influence on the results of the negotiation algorithm which leads to the best agents (resources) coalition for a given task. Moreover, several interesting problems have been addressed in order to make agents negotiation strategies more competitive and adequate. This is the case of the “self depreciation problem” which arises when an agent (a resource) belongs to more than one coalition which alters its own behaviour during the competition between those coalitions. Our negotiation protocol and agents strategies are able to provide the company with a precise idea about the respective importance of each resource and reach a solution, i.e. find the best set of resources, to deal competitively with the task in hands. Another important factor our approach takes into account during agents negotiation, is the influence of time (date of task announcement, starting and ending task dates) which may guide each agent negotiation strategy according with a forecast of their own employment possibilities in the future. We conclude the paper with a description of a realistic example in the civil construction domain, which illustrates the concepts we have developed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1997."

Pre-tender planning leading to a cost estimate is normally used as a baseline for project control in the subsequent project stages. That is, construction planning and cost estimation are done in parallel to reach a realistic cost estimate. However, not enough scheduling can be done at the tender stage because scheduling requires a certain level of detail for the work items. It is proposed that the misconception that the contractor is able to submit a full-fledged detailed construction schedule on awarding of the contract, followed later by regular updates, be replaced with a rolling-wave concept that permits work items with different levels of detail to be shown simultaneously in any version of the schedule. A procedure for generating the first construction program and gradually developing it during the construction phase is proposed. This procedure is aimed at allowing engineers and contractors the opportunity to understand the intrinsic principles for proper administration of the construction schedule."

The role it plays in these systems is primarily to integrate and manage elements that support system operations. In other words, software has transformed what were previously considered to be largely static systems to active, dynamic systems. In general, infrastructure system software is characterized by an emphasis on the following core functions: (1) sensor management; (2) data analysis; (3) data management; and (4) equipment control interfaces. As the nature of infrastructure systems changes, the tools available to support their design and management must change as well. The construction engineering community has developed sound techniques and resources to support the estimation of costs for physical construction of infrastructure systems. However, such tools are not readily available to support the cost estimation of the software component of infrastructure system development and construction. In this research effort, a widely used software engineering cost-estimation technique, the construction cost model (COCOMO), was examined to determine if it is effective for infrastructure system application. This examination included a sample application of COCOMO to an infrastructure system software project and a critical analysis of the technique itself. The examination revealed that COCOMO is extremely sensitive to small variations in an estimator's judgment, and that the foundation of the COCOMO model is poorly suited for infrastructure system application. As a result, it is recommended that a research and development program be initiated to create specific tools to support the cost estimation of infrastructure system software development. © ASCE."

Today, project teams often perform constructability reviews during the design phase to identify design constraints that limit a constructor's ability to perform construction operations effectively and increase construction cost. However, the current manual process is time-consuming and prone to error and does not identify the cost implications of constructability problems. Consequently, many constructability problems either go undetected or unnoticed, resulting in inefficiencies in the project delivery process and increased construction cost. This paper describes a vision for on-line computer tools that provide cost-specific constructability feedback to help project teams develop more cost-effective and constructable designs. Through a case example, we outline new functionality and the corresponding formalisms and mechanisms needed to model the cost implications of different constructability problems and identify the specific design conditions that impact constructability and increase construction cost. These contributions will allow project teams to leverage IFC-based product models and enable the necessary functionality to identify constructability problems and their impact on construction costs early in the project delivery process."

Contract terms offered to engineering consultants by clients and contractors may seek to allocate risk for many project aspects which are beyond the control of the contractual capacity of the consultant. One of the major client benefits is the ability of all parties to carry manageable levels of risk and liability which can be covered with a complaint professional indemnity (PI) insurance policy."

The calculation of the impacts of alternative decisions on the cost of the building must be a continuous activity. The models developed for architectural practices and construction companies should provide tools that integrate this activity into the building production process. In certain project delivery systems, e.g., design/build, the continuity and integration of the cost estimation function gains importance. That is why the cost estimation system should be designed not only to meet the requirements of a particular phase of a project (i.e., design, bidding, construction, or operation) or a certain type of firm that undertakes the project (i.e., architectural office, client organization, or contracting company) but also to integrate the information systems used by the organizations undertaking different roles in the various phases of the building production process. This paper presents an integrated system (MITOS) and its cost estimation module that have been designed primarily for design/build firms, i.e., firms or alliances of firms that do both design and construction. The cost estimation module was designed to achieve integration and continuity of the cost estimation function by introducing a model that is based on project-based productivity information in similar past projects. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The new metro line is located completely underground and comes to the surface only at the vehicle depot. This article represents activities undertaken during the final phase of the tunnel design including design review (5), and risk analysis of the lines critical sections, (4). The line consists of ten stations and two parallel running tunnels. A platform length of 80 m typically defines the station size, however local modifications to the station structure are required to improve connections to the surface. The distance between stations ranges from 300 to 1 400 m, depending on requirements from the surface, environment and volume of expected passengers, and necessary connections to other public traffic sources. For the running tunnels, the overburden is in the range of 9 to 28.5 m. One half of the line is located on Buda side and the other section on the Pest side of the city with an undercrossing section of the river Danube. Geological conditions on the two sides of the city are completely different. The Buda side has Oligocene formations, and the Pest side is characterized by soft ground, sand and silt formations with high groundwater level. During design review activities some suggestions could be implemented on the shape and sizes of the proposed subway line elements. Construction costs were estimated for several line variants, consisting of different construction methods and their combination. Cost estimation has shown possibilities for further cost reductions and improvements to the line concept. The undercrossing of the Danube river, the most interesting section of the line, was considered with special attention. All prospective hazards during the process of developing the new subway line were considered within risk analysis. The analysis takes into account: construction methodologies, local construction market circumstances, risk assessment during design, construction and operation periods, and the evaluation of construction costs for several construction variants."

A number of various modeling methodologies and modeling designs have been proposed including such development frameworks as neural networks, fuzzy and neurofuzzy models. In this study, we introduce a concept of self-organizing neurofuzzy networks (SONFN), a hybrid modeling architecture combining neurofuzzy networks (NFN) and polynomial neural networks (PNN). For these networks we develop a comprehensive design methodology. The construction of SONFNs takes advantage of the well-established technologies of computational intelligence (CI), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks and genetic algorithms. The architecture of the SONFN results from a synergistic usage of NFNs and PNNs. NFN contributes to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the SONFN. The consequence part of the SONFN is designed using PNNs. We discuss two types of SONFN architectures whose taxonomy is based on the NFN scheme being applied to the premise part of SONFN. We introduce a comprehensive learning algorithm. It is shown that this network exhibits a dynamic structure as the number of its layers as well as the number of nodes in each layer of the SONFN are not predetermined (as this is the case in a popular topology of a multilayer perceptron).

In most cases, this requires immense effort, a huge amount of historical data from similar projects and detailed design of the proposed development, which is usually not available in the conceptual and appraisal stages of the project. It would be valuable to have a simulation model based on stochastic functions that map a set of input parameters to a set of outputs by translating the predetermined scope to quantities and then predictive costs.This could then be used in concept selection studies, sensitivity analysis and optimisation in the front-end and development planning stages of an offshore project. This paper compares the neuro-fuzzy modelling techniques with multiple linear regression analysis in the development of cost estimating relationships and predicting the cost of offshore structures in the conceptual phase. The results are benchmarked against actual project results, comparing the accuracy, effectiveness and practicality of the both methods.This study is a part of the author’s ongoing research into the development of a probabilistic cost engineering model for offshore structures at the University of Western Australia. It is expected that this research will contribute greatly to the development of decision support systems in offshore construction cost engineering and improve confidence levels in conceptual cost estimates, thus facilitating a comprehensive front-end evaluation of offshore developments especially for marginal fields. © 2005 2005 Taylor and Francis Group LLC."

The method addresses the customization requirements of a class of products that are complex in configuration, multi-functional and structurally similar. We formulate catalog-based customization as an optimization problem consistent with the manufacturer's goal of incurring minimal costs in the redesign of existing standard components, while meeting customer specifications and satisfying design constraints. The 'catalog-based' nature of the formulation raises concomitant issues of cost function development and problem simplification/solution. We identify the generational structure as best suited to exploit the cost data in existing catalogs and construct a product cost function. The cost-estimation methods used by the generational structure in the construction are identified as weight-based-for modeling the material costs, and methods based on similarity principles and regression analyses-for the production costs. The optimization formulation of catalogbased customization may be simplified by an a priori identification of a standard catalog design as the customization basis. This is accomplished with function costing-a cost-estimation hypothesis that uses product functionality to develop an approximate cost-estimate. The function-costing estimate is also used to abstract features from the standard base design into the optimization formulation. The preferred solution strategy for the optimization formulation is identified as genetic algorithms. We apply the customization method developed to Brushless D.C. Permanent Magnet (BDCPM) motors and obtain optimal minimal cost custom designs (from the standard designs of a BDCPM motor family) for different sets of customer requirements.

Careful reading of the reports is required for better understanding of power and desalted water production economics, and better planning and utilization of the available resources. The published data in the 2000 MEW statistical books on power and desalted water reveal some of the main characteristics of the cogeneration power desalting plants in Kuwait, and raise some concern and comments that are reported in this paper such as: (1) MEW future planning is coping very well with electric power demand, but can face real shortage of fresh water in the immediate near future; (2) Desalting seawater is done using the MSF desalting method. The MSF system is not energy efficient. It consumes about three times the equivalent energy consumed by reverse osmosis (RO), which only consumes mechanical (pumping) energy. (3) There is mismatching between power production (depends on load) and process heat required by the operating MSF desalting units. (4) Demands of electric power and desalted water are continuously increasing, as does the need for installing new power and desalting plants. There is real need to rationalize the public use of water and power. (5) Variation of electric power demands is significant due to power consumed by A/C units. (6) Operation of power plants is at low capacity most of the year, due to part-load operation, except for a few hours at peak demand in summer. This means inefficient use of fuel energy and existing equipment. (7) High cost of generating power and desalted water. (8) Low fuel cost estimation by MEW. These points are discussed in this paper. The paper also introduces a method to allocate fuel energy consumption between desalted water and electric power production and use it to estimate the cost of each product.

The ideal method of evaluating the plan is to simulate models that incorporate the details of the plan and that rely on fundamental engineering analysis and estimated performance, cost and availability of resources.

It proceeds on the basis that in a free market, the lowest cost of a product will emerge over time and this cost can be roughly approximated from the product's primary performance function. In this paper, we validate the function-costing hypothesis for Brushless D.C. permanent magnet motors (BDCPMMs). The principal function of these motors is to provide torque and the peak torque is chosen as the primary performance function. From the cost-peak torque data of a family of eight BDCPMMs produced by a motor manufacturer, we obtain a regression-based cost-estimation relation based on the function-costing hypothesis. The manufacturing processes involved in the BDCPMM construction are studied. A detailed cost-estimation function - in terms of the BDCPMM design variables - is developed using the principle of similarity and the cost data from the eight motors. The costs of constructing a motor for different peak torques is then obtained from a nonlinear discrete optimization formulation (minimumcost objective), which is solved using a genetic algorithm. These costs compare well with the costs predicted by function-costing and validate the hypothesis for BDCPMMs. Finally, we investigate potential applications of function-costing to BDCPMM redesign. © 1997 by ASME."

This is because, in the absence of accurate cost control mechanisms, maintenance expenditure can exceed capital cost. In order to address this problem, a methodology is presented for predicting life cycle maintenance expenditure over the useful life of tracked hydraulic excavators. First, time series analysis (using a moving centred average) illustrates that the trend in maintenance cost expenditure is difficult to isolate due to large perturbations in periodic unscheduled maintenance. Such expenditure accounts for 92% of total maintenance cost. Second, cumulative costs of maintenance are modelled using a cubic equation, with time (in hours) as the predictor (xn) variable. Model performance is robust with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99 and a mean percentage error (MPE) of minus 3.94. The paper concludes with direction for future research in this field, particularly with respect to expanding the model's application to machines of various weights, manufacturers and machines operating in other industries, and determination of criteria with which to predict when a plant item will reach the end of its useful life. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd."

This method requires expected cashflows in the numerator and a risk-adjusted required rate of return in the denominator in order to calculate net present value. The capital expenditure (CAPEX) of a project is one of the major cashflows used to calculate net present value. Usually the CAPEX is given by a single cost figure, with some indication of its probability distribution. In the oil industry and many other industries, it is a common practice to report a CAPEX that is the estimated 50/50 (median) CAPEX instead of the estimated expected (expected value) CAPEX. In this article, we domonstrate how the practice of using a 50/50 (median) CAPEX, when the cost distributions are asymmetric, causes project valuation errors and therefore may lead to wrong investment decisions with acceptance of projects that have negative net present values. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A simulation approach to implementing ABV first applies a ground motion time history to a structural model to determine structural response. The response is applied to assembly fragility functions to simulate damage to each structural and nonstructural element in the building, and to its contents. Probabilistic construction cost estimation and scheduling are used to estimate repair cost and loss-of-use duration as random variables. It also provides a framework for accumulating post-earthquake damage observations in a statistically systematic and consistent manner.

Eighteen actual cases of highway projects constructed in Newfoundland, Canada, have been used as the source of cost data. Rather than using black-box NN software, a simple NN simulation has been developed in a spreadsheet format that is customary to many construction practitioners. As an alternative to NN training, two techniques were used to determine network weights: (1) simplex optimization; and (2) genetic algorithms (GAs). Accordingly, the weights that produced the best cost prediction for the historical cases were used to find the optimum NN. To facilitate the use of this NN on new projects, a user-friendly interface was developed using spreadsheet macros to simplify user input and automate cost prediction. For practicality, sensitivity analysis and adaptation modules have also been incorporated to account for project uncertainty and to reoptimize the model on new historical data. Details regarding model development and capabilities have been discussed in an attempt to encourage practitioners to benefit from the NN technique."

Relying on common standards such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) from the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI), is seen as a main instrument for information exchange between heterogeneous information sources and applications.

In this paper, we evaluate four missing data techniques (MDTs) in the context of software cost modeling: listwise deletion (LD), mean imputation (MI), similar response pattern imputation (SRPI), and full information maximum likelihood (FIML). We apply the MDTs to an ERP data set, and thereafter construct regression-based prediction models using the resulting data sets. The evalution suggests that only FIML is appropriate when the data are not missing completely at random (MCAR). Unlike FIML, prediction models constructed on LD, MI and SRPI data sets will be biased unless the data are MCAR. Furthermore, compared to LD, MI and SRPI seem appropriate only if the resulting LD data set is too small to enable the construction of a meaningful regression-based prediction model."

However, construction cost estimation is difficult to precisely evaluate in an uncertain environment and measured quantities are always burdened with different types of cost structures. Therefore, an understanding of the previous development of wastewater treatment plants and of the related construction cost structures of those facilities becomes essential for dealing with an effective regional water pollution control program. But deviations between the observed values and the estimated values are supposed to be due to measurement errors only in the conventional regression models. The inherent uncertainties of the underlying cost structure, where the human estimation is influential, are rarely explored. This paper is designed to recast a well-known problem of construction cost estimation for both domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants via a comparative framework. Comparisons were made for three technologies of regression analyses, including the conventional least squares regression method, the fuzzy linear regression method, and the newly derived fuzzy goal regression method. The case study, incorporating a complete database with 48 domestic wastewater treatment plants and 29 industrial wastewater treatment plants being collected in Taiwan, implements such a cost estimation procedure in an uncertain environment. Given that the fuzzy structure in regression estimation may account for the inherent human complexity in cost estimation, the fuzzy goal regression method does exhibit more robust results in terms of some criteria. Moderate economy of scale exists in constructing both the domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants. Findings indicate that the optimal size of a domestic wastewater treatment plant is approximately equivalent to 15 000 m3/day (CMD) and higher in Taiwan. Yet the optimal size of an industrial wastewater treatment plant could fall in between 6000 CMD and 20 000 CMD. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

It does not depend on the architecture of the neural network, the learning parameters, and the number of iterations required for training the system. Moreover, the problem of noise in the data is taken into account in a rational manner."

However, energy is necessary not only for exploitation but also for the creation of buildings: manufacture of building materials, transportation and construction. For global energy saving in the construction industry, at the state level, it is important to determine an optimum ratio between energy requirement for building creation and exploitation. Taking into account the durability of buildings for the evaluation of strategic relation ships between energetics and construction industry it is reasonable to use a physical building life cycle energy requirement model, because the reliability of an economical prognosis is usually lower than that in physical processes. In this work generalised ratios are suggested for energy requirement by the main building materials, which can be used in the calculation of a physical building life cycle model. In collecting this information three sources were used, namely: from Lithuania, former USSR and Western countries. In the beginning we hoped that the collected information would show higher energy needs for the production of building materials in Lithuania and other former USSR countries than those in developed countries, where manufacturing technology is more modern, and energy saving measures have been implemented earlier. After collecting more data, it was evident from foreign—literature that in Western countries the energy needs are bigger because they are based on other energy needs estimation levels. In the estimation data of energy needs for the Lithuanian building materials industry the levels of technological processes are not clearly described. In this case an application of such data for a physical model of life cycle cost estimations cannot be used directly. For a more detailed analysis 10 building materials were chosen: silicate brick, ceramic brick, rockwool, polyctirol, cement, timber, steel, glass, concrete, ferro-concrete. Energy requirements are classified according to 4 levels of full technological processes, i.e.: for the main process, for raw materials, for machines and for machines that produce these machines. Taking into account the indetermination of the information of data sources, the values can be recommended only for a tentative evaluation. More precise values can be obtained by a detailed analysis of the Lithuanian industry. For building construction industry prognosis one monitoring for building and insulation material manufacturing processes is necessary taking into account different technological levels and processes. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

This flexibility often creates problems with respect to pricing and payment regulations. Together with the demand that the measuring and cost compensation rules should be comprehensible and objectively comparable, the problem becomes even more complex. To meet these requirements, the ÖN B2203-1 intorduced a completely new approach to classify excavation - namely a numerical evaluation of the amount of support and the round length for top heading and bench. The excavation class for the invert is determined by the round length and on the type of support (open invert, invert slab or invert arch). In the eight years since its enforcement, the new ÖN B2203 has been used in 15 railway and road tunnels in Austria. It can therefore be stated that the objectives of the new Standard, that is, to create an objective and reliable basis for cost estimation, measuring and compensation have been reached. Part 2 iof the new ÖNORM is about TBM tunnelling and is based on the above mentioned standard for conventional excavation. A new approach is taken, however, in major points. The novelties in particular concern the definition of excavation classes, which are displayed as a matrix similar as in Part 1, and the formulation of rules for measuring and compensation of major items like excavation, support, hindrances, and difficulties, additional and special measures. It is expected that the new standard will be applied for the first time to the railway tunnels planned in Austria over the next few years."

We proposed the Gas Lift Advanced Dissolution (GLAD) System for efficient sequestration of pure CO2 at deep sea. The GLAD system is an inverse-J pipeline set in the ocean between 200 and 3000 m in depth. We have recently improved it to treat low-purity CO2 gas to reduce the cost for separation and capture of CO2 from exhausted gas. The newly developed system, named the Progressive Gas Lift Advanced Dissolution (P-GLAD) System, is to dissolve low-purity CO2 bubbles into seawater at a depth of 200-300 m and at the same time sequestrate CO2 at the deep sea of 1000-3000 m. Previous ideas of deep-sea sequestration of CO2, including storage of liquid CO2 on the deep-sea floor and direct releasing of liquid CO2 into the deep sea, necessitate the consumption of a huge amount of energy, because the realization of these ideas requires both high-purity capture of CO2 from exhausted gas and liquefaction of the CO2. To realize deep-sea sequestration of CO2 with low energy consumption and low environmental impact, we utilize a gas-lift effect to simultaneously dissolve low-purity CO2 gas into shallow seawater and transport the CO2 solution to a great depth. The present paper describes basic characteristics and performance of the P-GLAD system for low-purity CO2 gases, experimentally and numerically. It is demonstrated that the system has satisfactory ability to both dissolve CO2 gas and pump the CO2 solution. To confirm economic feasibility of the P-GLAD System, we also discuss the overall cost estimation including an additional system for CO2 capturing as well as the construction of P-GLAD. The cost for the P-GLAD is estimated to be half of those for previous ideas."

One focus of this study was the development of water pollution perspectives during the last 50 years, including social perceptions of water pollution problems and societal judgements of the feasibility and practicability of various ways to solve them. Another focus was the conceptualizations of water pollution, made by natural scientists and technicians, who are viewed as crucial suppliers of knowledge. The concern for health, dominating Swedish water policy since the middle of the 19'th century, gave priority to local hygienic improvement by the construction of drinking water supply and wastewater removal systems. The initial abatement strategy aimed at mitigating local effects by the maintenance of self-purifying capacities of the recipients and treatment of drinking water. In the middle of this century source-related pollution abatement methods were introduced in reply to increasing needs for drinking water and social recreational demands. The development was limited by administrative and technical capacity, cost estimations setting the standards of feasibility. In the 1960's time and space perspectives were extended. The holistic view of cycling within and between ecosystems made the impacts of non point sources upon water quality visible. The pollution control perspective is now gradually being replaced by the goal of sustainable resource management, adding the notion of pollution prevention. During the last 50 years temporal and spatial scales have been widened. Measures taken did not correspond to current conceptualizations of water pollution. Considerable lags of implementation were found and technical solutions accumulated into infrastructural networks of an increasing magnitude and complexity. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

Economic and financial savings in vehicle operating costs were generated using both methods. The economic parameters calculated in both methods were the net present value, the benefit-cost ratio and the internal rate of return.

The two major factors that influence the cost estimation of a tunnelling project are the uncertainties in predicting geological conditions along the proposed tunnel line and choosing the opimal construction method to match the geologic conditions. Determining the optimal construction method minimizes the time-to-completion thus reducing the total project cost. A computer model has been developed to undertake a detailed feasibility analysis by integrating the techniques of probability, statistics, simulation, and spreadsheet manipulation. By varying the input data, sensitivity analyses can be performed quickly and efficiently. Computer modelling is therefore a most attractive and cost-effective method for estimation of the costs and scheduling of tunnelling projects in variable geological environments. -from Authors"

One problem associated with life-cycle cost estimation, as currently implemented, is that the costs associated with natural hazards, particularly future earthquakes, are not taken into consideration. The present paper provides a framework in which not only the initial capital and discounted maintenance cost but also the discounted cost for seismic retrofit and damage/ repair cost from seismic events can be combined for a more realistic life-cycle cost estimation for bridges that are located in earthquake-prone areas.

In a similar fashion, the term cost engineer can have different meanings, depending largely on the area of practice in which it is used. The American Association of Cost Engineers defines it as 'an engineer whose judgement and experience are utilized in the application of scientific principles and techniques to problems of cost estimation; cost control; business planning and management science; profitability analysis; and project management, planning and scheduling.'

Tokens are objects with specific properties. Token propagation through structural links allows aggregate Information to be collected automatically at different levels of detail. The transition firing is a nonvolatile process and creates new token instances with time dependent information. The typed places, together with connections among them, defines the static construct of a project. Whenever transitions are fired, the project execution history is recorded by the token instances created. Using the model, we have provided definitions for basic properties of a successful project, namely connectedness, plan complete, plan consistent, and well-executed. We have given algorithms for computing these functions and shown that the computing time is linear in the size of the project. This assures that any system based on DesignNet should be able to compute these functions efficiently.

The first deals with the assumption of a probability distribution shape for an individual variable cost component. Previous papers have suggested (Eschenbach, Mlakar and Bryant, Spooner, Knoke and Spittler) that the right-skewed triangular distribution is a reasonable choice. Spooner (1974) postulated that the PERT-beta and uniform distributions can be accepted as extremes of reasonable variable behavior, maintaining that the triangular distribution offer a reasonable compromise and introduces an error of only 2 to 3% in the mean values. A second issue centers around the idea of simulation. The argument is that, because the variables in an estimate cannot really be independent, the simplifying assumptions used in direct methods necessarily bias the results. Therefore, the only satisfactory method to overcome the interdependency limitation is by simulation. The authors find the discussion of these two issues to be interesting.

This paper briefly reviews some estimating basics, the impact of existing practice as well as the definition, goal and framework of the integrated estimating technique. The role of computerized and manual estimating methods are examined within a large framework of a total project cost estimate. While the paper is written to apply this technique for a combination of a grass-roots and revamp-type of project, it can also be used for proposal estimates where access to site facilities is available for actual quantity takeoffs. Frequently high accuracy is required for economic evaluation of a proposal estimate. The key is to gather as much detail as possible, quantify the same, and by combining the two estimating techniques, maximize the accuracy of the estimate and minimize preparation time. It is to this end that this paper is dedicated."

Early indications are that DOE's change in policy on ES&H issues could have a significant impact on the cost of its construction projects. This paper presents an analysis of the potential impact of increased rigor (IR) on project cost based on estimates prepared during the first two years of implementation. This analysis is part of an ongoing study to identify and analyze the activities that are impacted by IR in order to maintain cost control while assuring full compliance and minimizing cost increases."

Simple methods for producing accurate estimates are needed at the beginning of a project. However, existing methods have limited applicability and disappointing accuracy. Plants with similar specifications (capacities, process conditions, etc.) have similar costs, therefore we have tried using the capital cost of the existing plant that is 'most like' the proposed plant as an estimate of the cost of the new plant. We have developed fuzzy matching, a method based on fuzzy logic, which finds the 'most like' plant from a database of existing plants by quantifying the closeness of their specifications. Fuzzy matching has since been enhanced by testing different functions for quantifying closeness, and 'optimising' parameters in these functions. The method has been extended to take account of plant materials of construction. Finally, the closeness of individual specifications has been weighted in the calculations of the quantity expressing overall closeness, to account for the different degree of influence of the specifications on the capital cost. Fuzzy matching offers accurate preliminary capital cost estimates, especially when compared with existing methods, and with minimal estimating effort. © 1995."

The first, associated resource impact costs, deals with the costs that arise when failure in one machine impacts on the productivity and cost-effectiveness of other machines working in close association with it. The second category, lack-of-readiness costs, addresses the cost that may be incurred when a capital asset is rendered idle by the downtime resulting from a prior failure. The third cost category, service level impact costs, deals with the situation that arises when one machine in a pool of resources fails to the extent that other machines in the pool must work in an uneconomical manner to maintain a given service level. The fourth cost category, alternative method impact costs, deals with the consequential costs that arise when failure causes a change in the method of operations. The methodology developed represents a significant step toward the rational quantification of consequential costs. An understanding of the philosophy behind each category, as well as the methodology used for quantification, should make it possible to model most situations, given a little thought and creativity in applying the model. © ASCE."

These uncertainties can lead to several changes in project scope during the process of project execution. Unless the changes are properly controlled, the time, cost and quality goals of the project may never be achieved. A methodology is proposed for project control through risk analysis, contingency allocation and hierarchical planning models. Risk analysis is carried out through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) due to the subjective nature of risks in construction projects. The results of risk analysis are used to determine the logical contingency for project control with the application of probability theory. Ultimate project control is carried out by hierarchical planning model which enables decision makers to take vital decisions during the changing environment of the construction period. Goal programming (GP), a multiple criteria decision-making technique, is proposed for model formulation because of its flexibility and priority-base structure. The project is planned hierarchically in three levels-project, work package and activity. GP is applied separately at each level. Decision variables of each model are different planning parameters of the project. In this study, models are formulated from the owner's perspective and its effectiveness in project control is demonstrated. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd and IPMA."

These contingencies are often added as a 'fudge factor.' As one author points out, all too often the money added to the bottom-line estimate is very much a matter of guesswork. Not until the project is completed is it determined that the contingency added to the bottom line was too low (ie, did not adequately protect the owner from criticism and possible embarrassment), or too high (ie, unnecessarily obligating public funds). This paper will focus on one method that can be utilized by public sector, as well as private sector, owners to develop a contingency amount for construction contracts.

The maritime traffic is considered as a complex dynamic system within which, through a horizontal analysis, some subsystems have been identified, representing the traffic and port activities as well as the construction and exploitation of the sea route. The author points to the theoretically substained statement that one of the most important instruments within the national maritime policy is the use of the appropriate method of dividing the sea route costs among its users. The already mentioned statement is proved by the shipping industry cost estimate analysis method where, the three ships engaged in the liner, tanker and tramp market estimate the valuable rate of cost of the sea-trade route within the cost estimate of a line service and a voyage charter. A recommendation is given to the shipowners to separate analytically in their cost estimate, the sea route costs within different countries from the port tariffs, since the former represent a very high value. -from English summary"

A great deal of software is now available to deal with tracking, scheduling, and detail estimating of construction projects. However, there are few programs available to generate a cost estimate from minimal details. Parametric estimation structures the detailed line items of completed projects into smaller groupings, or assemblies, with a relationship to known variables, or parameters. Through these parameters, such as gross square footage or length of pipe, a new detailed estimate can be generated from an old estimate. There are many uses for this type of estimating process. An estimator might use this approach as a quick check on a final estimate to confirm that no major cost items have been neglected. Parametric estimating can also be used to generate detail for the early stages of design when there is no formal design drawn on paper. With the use of multiple construction systems (assemblies), the estimator can perform a value analysis on the different systems to decide which is the lowest-costing system."

Such knowledge bases cannot be built using existing tools such as expert system shells, because these do not scale up, nor can they be built in terms of existing database technology, because such technology does not support the rich representational structure and inference mechanisms required for knowledge-based systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a knowledge base management system intended for such applications. The architecture assumes an object-oriented knowledge representation language with an assertional sublanguage used to express constraints and rules. It also provides for general-purpose deductive inference and special-purpose temporal reasoning. Results reported in the paper address several knowledge base management issues. For storage management, a new method is proposed for generating a logical schema for a given knowledge base. Query processing algorithms are offered for semantic and physical query optimization, along with an enhanced cost model for query cost estimation. On concurrency control, the paper describes a novel concurrency control policy which takes advantage of knowledge base structure and is shown to outperform two-phase locking for highly structured knowledge bases and update-intensive transactions. Finally, algorithms for compilation and efficient processing of constraints and rules during knowledge base operations are described. The paper describes original results, including novel data structures and algorithms, as well as preliminary performance evaluation data. Based on these results, we conclude that knowledge base management systems which can accommodate large knowledge bases are feasible. © Springer-Verlag 1996."

It is influenced by a lot of uncertainty factors with the randomness. The construction cost is decomposed into several subconstruction costs according to the decomposability of system. The fuzzy estimation model of subconstruction cost is established by employing the near-degree theory in fuzzy mathematics. Based on the subjective estimation method, the value of expectation and variance of several subconstruction were determined. Then, the expected value and variance of total construction cost of hydropower engineering were deduced by using theory of multivariate stochastic variable and the relation curve was defined between cost and probability.

Despite the proliferation of estimating tools, bid proposals focus primarily on the computational component and leave the more difficult aspects of risk assessment and mark-up estimation to estimators’ judgement. This may lead to unrealistic estimates that do not account for the operational environment of projects. Such estimates often result in either losing bids or inflicting undesirable cost overruns. In an effort to circumvent such drawbacks, this paper presents a structured system for cost estimation and bid preparation. Unlike current tools, the proposed system supports a holistic bid-preparation process, accounting for a number of quantitative as well as qualitative factors that are used in practice for bid preparation. The system incorporates three principal features: 1 Integrated cost and schedule computation 2 Adequate risk assessment and mark-up estimation 3 Optimum bid unbalancing and cash flow optimization. The developments made in the integrated system are described along with a PC-based prototype Estimator, developed to automate the process. An example application is presented to illustrate the capabilities and essential features of the prototype and demonstrate its practicality. © 1994, MCB UP Limited"

For a reliable cost estimation at the conceptual stage of a building project, the missing data and information, otherwise needed for a detailed cost estimate, have to be substituted by the knowledge of an experienced cost-engineer. Typically, a senior member of the contractor's organization is involved in the conceptual cost estimating process. The decisions are based on that individual's experience. His experience may constrain, or even bias, the selection of cost objectives. This can lead to an estimate that is not optimal. This paper describes the development of a prototype knowledge based system, aimed to assist the cost estimator in the conceptual cost estimate.

The purpose of this study was to develop a procedure for applying CAPDET to the capital cost estimation of Canadian wastewater treatment plants without altering the source code. The proposed methodology is simple and efficient, requiring no additional data to that normally used in CAPDET. A total of 10 Canadian wastewater treatment plants were studied which included many of the treatment processes used in Canada. Six plants were used to develop the procedure while four plants were used to verify the procedure. The design flow for the selected plants ranged between 550 and 13,600 m3/d. Construction cost estimates generated using site-specific design information were compared with those obtained using the default database provided in CAPDET. The importance of the various unit costs on the total plant cost was also determined. Under the proposed methodology, unit costs are first adjusted to the data of construction using appropriate inflation indices. Wall concrete, slab concrete, and excavation costs are increased by an additional 15, 50, and 25%, respectively, to account for differences in construction practice. A final estimate reduction of 15% is performed to account for Canadian conditions. The procedure provides construction cost estimates that are within ± 20% of actual construction costs with a mean absolute error of 11% and an average error of 2.3%. Site-specific design data had little effect on the construction cost estimates with the exception of lagoon treatment facilities. Utilities and support facilites accounted for 20-30% of the cost estimates. The most significant cost parameters were the inflation index values and concrete and building unit costs."

This is often the case in developing countries, and SAM is illustrated by an example concerning appraisal of low-volume rural roads in the Philippines. Most project appraisal methodologies are based on cost-benefit analysis techniques in which costs and benefits for the design life of the projects are estimated and net present values or internal rates of return are calculated. One of the main obstacles to the use of such methods is the tremendous data requirement for the applied benefit and cost estimation models. The use of a statistical regression technique on readily available data or those with a low collection cost is suggested as a method for limiting the requirements for data with a high collection cost. In addition to SAM, a simplified method, budget level test (BLT), is introduced. BLT measures the efficiency of a simplified appraisal method - in this case, SAM - compared with that of cost-benefit analysis. Application of the programming methodology presented indicates that the data requirements in the appraisal type dealt with can be lowered by 50 percent without seriously jeopardizing the quality of the appraisal."

A number of design variables like different structural schemes, grid sizes, number of storeys, grades of concrete, grid location and section of beams have been incorporated in the model to assess their effect on cost and quantities of constituents of concrete construction. The use of the model is recommended for comparative cost estimation to determine the effect of design parameters on structural cost; for approximate structural cost estimation of an overall project; for checking of estimates for structural works; for calculation of quantity index for structural schemes and system; for budgeting of materials and finally for use in various studies in building economics. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This construction has included major infrastructure, along with private and public building facilities. Because the construction of most of these facilities has been completed, their maintenance problems have become mainly the responsibility of the owners and maintenance contractors. The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between owners and maintenance contractors in terms of the interface problems between them. A questionnaire has been developed to determine the main problems between the two parties and to rank the importance of these problems. The questionnaire includes the assessment of the following main problems: lack of accuracy in specification and standards, owners' low budget, unspecified labor skills in the agreement contract, lack of a penalty clause in the contract, inappropriate schedule of payments, lack of a training program for the maintenance team, lack of cost indexes for materials, labor, and equipment to be used by the owner for cost estimation, lack of labor incentives and inaccurate estimation of maintenance costs by contractors. The result of the survey indicates that the lack of direct supervision by the contractor, lack of accuracy in specification and standards, and owners' low budget allocations were ranked the highest in terms of interface problems, while laborers illiteracy was ranked the lowest. © ASCE."

AFBCost allows the user to carry out a generic cost and performance analysis of alternative circulating fluidized-bed combustion (CFBC) technologies and then to upgrade that analysis to consider such site-specific conditions as construction labor productivity and cost, seismic conditions, land availability, design ambient conditions, etc. Both grass-roots plants and repowering of an existing steam turbogenerator can be done for plant capacities in the range of 50 to 200 MMe. The program accurately reproduces the cost and performance data for a number of constructed FBC plants by using quantity based capital cost estimation procedures.

In preparing a bid, a contractor estimates the direct cost of each item and then has to spread overhead, profit, and contingency to the bid items, so that these amounts will be recovered when the project is complete. The contractor's bidding strategy is complicated by the uncertainties of the work quantities and which items may be deleted from the contract. To minimize the cash investment required by the contract and maximize the expected profit, it is beneficial to ″unbalance″ the bid prices by allocating a larger than proportional share of the margin and overhead to those items performed early in the life of the project and those likely to overrun the owner's estimated quantity. This paper develops an easily implemented model of the preceding problem which permits the calculation of optimal ″unbalanced″ bid prices that will maximize the expected net worth of the project for a given desired margin."

Developing accurate construction cost estimates is complicated because estimates are based on assumptions always subject to change. These changes coupled with the rapid price changes for labor and materials can make the resulting actual cost vary considerably from the estimated cost. Widely accepted standards of conversion and cost estimation do not exist. There is no single cost-estimation process. In health care today, within 18 to 24 months, construction cost equals cost of operating a facility. Therefore, any compromise in planning, design, and construction stages will cost many more times the initial outlay over the life of a building. Life-cycle costing techniques and value engineering attempt to determine first costs versus cost over life of the facility itself."

Cost is one such criterion, being discrete and quantitative by nature. Yet it is not often used in early age design decisions nor during the design process because of accuracy issues and effort required to produce estimates. This paper describes a computer application developed to enable accurate cost estimation both in the initial phases of design and continuously thereafter. The computer system, COSTMOD, provides a tool for building and operating hierarchically structured models of projects. Models can be developed for classes of projects with project characteristics and required decisions as variables. Determination of hierarchical breakdown and component costs are then based upon these variables. Thus small quantities of input are expanded, based on design algorithms, good practice standards, or average usage statistics, into much greater detail and more accurate costs."

A recently completed tunnel project located in Utah is used as an example. Although cost estimating computer programs are used in tunnel project planning, the introduction of performance modeling, simulating the time to excavate, has added advantages that are explored here. The performance/cost tunneling model (TM) described herein mathematically simulates on a high-speed digital computer the important activities of a number of tunneling techniques accounting for activity interactions, variable external environments, mechanical failure, and other uncertainties. A cost accounting segment is included to facilitate cost-effectiveness comparisons. It is shown that, when combined with informed judgment and appreciation of limitations, the TM can be a useful tool that may help improve tunneling operations and cost estimation, for example, by achieving more balanced system designs or bounding the performance/cost implications of geologic and other uncertainties. Ultimately, this might lead to more competitive bids and greater profits."

These analyses were limited to methods for control in existing homes. Control through modified construction techniques was not evaluated. Methods assessed included increased air circulation, increased ventilation, particle removal using electrostatic precipitation and unipolar ion generation, and the application of sealants to room surfaces. Although surface sealants proved to be reasonably cost-effective per person-sievert dose reduction, such sealants are prone to cracking and the durability of their effectiveness is questionable. Use of ceiling fans for increased air circulation and particle deposition appears to be least cost-effective, but this method may be attractive in some cases for reasons of comfort. The use of unipolar ion generators appears to be the best approach from the standpoint of cost effectiveness. These devices are also easy to install and are esthetically readily acceptable. © 1984 Health Physics Society."

Present‐day cost estimation on a multi‐currency basis is becoming more and more complex due to the wild and frequent fluctuations of exchange rates and different inflationary trends in various countries. The preparation of comparatively accurate preliminary cost estimates, based on world‐wide procurement, overseas construction and engineering, became a major problem for companies like badger with international activities. To maintain an acceptable degree of accuracy, the traditional method of cost factor estimation has to be supplemented with a quantity and man‐hour ratio method. Basically, costs are related to quantities; therefore cost ratios can be converted into quantity ratios. Man‐hour ratios originate from the existing relationship between quantities, material costs, and field man‐hours to install these quantities. In this article the value of the Quantity Ratio Method as a tool in these unstable times will be stressed, as well as the added advantages it offers with regard to better cost control and communication.
